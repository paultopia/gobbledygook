For the duration of the indented block below that first line, all the code in there is going to be executed `with` the file `hello.text` being `open` and hence available for reading. Inside that block, the name `my_awesome_file` is going to be assigned to the open file (that's what the `as` statement does).  The second parameter to the `open` function, the `'r'`, just indicates that you're going to open it for reading---instead of, for example, opening it for writing, in which case the `r` would change to a `w`.  You can also open a file to append with `a`---to add more data to the bottom of the file.\n",

[Here's a table of ASCII numbers to letters](http://www.asciitable.com/).  You can still see that today.  For example:"

For example, there's an encoding called Latin-1 that a bunch of Microsoft products have been known to use. Sometimes, you'll see data (like maybe saved as a CSV from some version of Excel) in that character encoding, and then everything will look funny.  If you've ever opened a file with a bunch of question marks and weird black diamonds in place of characters you've expected to see (known as [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake)), that's because the program you used to open it thought it was a different character encoding than the program used to save it did.
