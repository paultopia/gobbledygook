    "## F-Test/ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "This (the one-way ANOVA, which follows the F distribution) is what you use to compare a bunch of means all at once. A significant p-value suggests that there's some difference between them, but doesn't tell you which one. Otherwise, it's basically the same (and rests on similar assumptions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's think about the current debates in college admissions, in which there's a claim that affirmative action discriminates against Asian-Americans. But also lots of white people claim that affirmative action discriminates again them, and ostensibly benefits other racialized groups.  One way we might take a first pass at figuring out if there's even a real difference is to compare whites, Asian-Americans, and everybody else.  (Again, this doesn't entail that there's discrimination, but it's a starting point.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example here, I'm going to try something a little funky.  I'm going to generate a bunch of distributions of fake data, some of them are going to show a difference and some aren't, and then we'll try to detect which ones actually are different and see how accurate we are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data will be SAT scores of admitted students to a hypothetical college, so the question will be: is there a difference among these groups in the average SAT score?  The [mean and SD SAT score are 1060 and 195, respectively](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_226.40.asp), so we will start with that as out canonical distribution.  In order to limit ourselves to the actual range of SAT scores (400-1600), we'll use a scipy function to generate a truncated normal, which is actually kind of obnoxious to use, but such is life."

    "These tests are a little bit harder to understand---they aren't perfect substitutes for the T test, and, under some circumstances, it doesn't make sense to say that they're about equality of means.  (I've read some descriptions according to which the null hypothesis to be constructed is really about difference of medians, I've also seen references to difference in distributions more broadly.  So I won't say much more about it here, except to let you know that it exists, and that [this explanation from UVA](https://data.library.virginia.edu/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test/) looks pretty good."
