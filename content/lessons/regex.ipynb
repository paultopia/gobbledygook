    "Regular expressions (or \"regex\"/\"regexes\") are one of the most powerful programming tools for lawyers. Essentially, regular expressions are a powerful specialized programming language built into other languages like Python, which allow you to express complicated text searching operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of this for lawyers should be obvious: lawyers have to deal with lots and lots and lots of documents, and sometimes need to search through those documents for specific information. If those documents are in electronic form, regular expressions can provide you with a much more powerful way of searching than what is built into ordinary applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example.  Suppose you've got a bunch of files. And suppose you're trying to find any document that contains a reference to specific dollar amounts---invoices, e-mails with discussions of financial matters, etc. One of the things you might do is search for anything in the usual format for representing dollars, i.e., a number with two digits after the decimal point, and, say, 1-8 digits before the decimal, maybe with commas in there.  (Let's suppose that you don't expect any bigger amounts of money to be at issue.)\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's create some pretend data.  In a real task, we'd probably have these files on disk somewhere, or in a database, and we'd open every file, search it, and save the document if it matched. Also, for this technique to be useful in a real task, we'd usually have hundreds or thousands of dollars. For the purposes of demonstration, however, we can put a handful of fake texts in memory."

The reason for the lowercase r is that it tells Python to ignore special characters in the string---instead of processing those characters in Python-ey ways, it'll process them in regex-ey ways.  You can just treat this as a rule: put a lowercase r before the string when you're making a regex pattern, and if you want the nitty-gritty technical details of why, look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871066/what-exactly-is-a-raw-string-regex-and-how-can-you-use-it).  \n",
