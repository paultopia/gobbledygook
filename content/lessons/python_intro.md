title: Introduction to Python

In this class, we will be using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. In this first week, we will have a basic introduction to Python and to the fundamentals of computer programming. 

Before we get started programming, we have to set up a system to write our code and get the computer to read it. Most introductory Python texts, including the texts we'll be working with, ask you to install an "interpreter"---a program on your own computer that can read and execute Python code. **We won't be doing that here.** (Feel free to install one and experiment, but it won't be officially supported by the course.)

Instead, all your code will run in the cloud. We'll be using a free service by Microsoft called [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/). This service will let you type in and execute your code online, through your web browser. This has some very large advantages: 

- You don't have to install anything locally, which can be problematic (especially for Windows users), and I don't have to try to debug your local installations.

- Azure Notebooks runs on notebook software called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which is built for data analysis (all the cool data scientist kiddos use it), so it has lots of nice facilities for exploring data and code incrementally, visualizing data, displaying tables, etc. 

In addition, I will ask you to make use of the free [Github](https://github.com/) service to "clone" (copy) assignments, which will be in notebook files that you can just run on Azure, as well as to turn those assignments in. 

There's an introductory video (**link to be added**) which shows you how to sign up for these services and some basic usage. Please watch that video, follow the steps, and also run the first notebook (assignment 0) before the first class.  In addition, please read pages 1-55 of Python for Everybody. (Don't worry if everything isn't super clear yet, we'll go over the same material in class.)
