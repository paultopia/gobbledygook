    "Let's simulate some housing discrimination tester data.  Suppose a testing organization hired 20 white people and 20 black people, trained them to behave identically and give identical answers to landlord questions, and sent them into a large housing complex to inquire about one-bedroom apartments.  The testers were instructed to ask how much rent is on one-bedrooms in the complex, but not to ask for an application---and then to record how much they were quoted, and whether they were offered an application anyway. \n",

There are three different flavors of the chi-squared test: a test for independence, for homogeneity, and for goodness of fit.

The most common explanation of the difference is that the test for independence is for research designs where you collect two observations for each member of the sample (i.e., their race and whether they were offered an application); whereas the test for homogeneity is for research designs where you sample the subpopulations separately, i.e., sample a bunch of white people and a bunch of black people and then observe who got an application.

    "What you are about to see is a pandas tool called a crosstab. You can use a pandas crosstab to compute a simple cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors. By default, it computes a frequency table of the factors unless an array of values and an aggregation function are passed. You can think of crosstabs as functioning similarly to the groupby and pivottable functions. With so many to choose from in Pandas, why would you want to use the crosstab function over another? The crosstab function works on numpy arrays or columns in a dataframe. Crosstabs are simple and the API is easier than with pivottables. They are also quite useful for some of the types of statistical analysis we will be doing in this class, because of how the crosstab formats the resulting data. Like most things in python, there's so much more you can do with crosstabs than is shown below. (Check out this site for a great explanation and a fun application of the crosstab function: https://pbpython.com/pandas-crosstab.html) For now, a simple way to remember how to use crosstab is with the following formula: pd.crosstab(df.variable1, df.variable2)."
