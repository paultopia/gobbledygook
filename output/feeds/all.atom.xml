&lt;p&gt;For the in-class time …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, we've survived our first week of Sociological Gobbledygook (and one room change---which we're keeping, BTW).  We've learned the basic mechanics of programming, and, more importantly, we've worked on building a mental model for how talking to a computer works by completing a number of exercises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the in-class time in week 2, expect more of the same, lots of exercises---but now they're going to get a little bit more complicated.  I'll also be pushing out the reading for week 3 soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, everyone should have a working Azure notebooks setup and a Github account; you should also have received an invitation e-mail to join DataCamp. I encourage you to take advantage of DataCamp beyond the stuff I've assigned: you have free access to all their lessons for the duration of the class period, but it usually costs $30/month, so milk it for all it's worth while you can. And let me know if there are any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I add new lessons, we'll have to talk a little bit more about how git works to enable you to pull the changes into your local version of them in Azure notebooks; please remind me to talk about that in class if I haven't gotten instructions posted by the beginning of next week...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a quick note: I've noticed a few people taking notes in the class, including snippets of code, in Microsoft Word.  Word is not a great choice for writing code, because it saves in a format that mucks around with the text encoding (and also might screw you up by using things like autocorrect), so there's a good chance that you won't just be able to run code saved in Word anywhere else.  I recommend using a professional-quality text editor ("text editor" is in opposition to "word processor," so also don't use Pages, WordPerfect, Google Docs, OpenOffice, etc.; text editors are also sometimes called "code editors.")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason to use a good text editor is that they all have packages that you can use to extend their functionality, for example to give them the power to take Python code files and highlight different elements (so, for example, strings are in a different color), auto-complete variable names to avoid typoes, and such.  Also, because they save in "plain text" format (you'll soon learn that there's really no such thing as plain text, but they save in as close as you need to plain text), you can use them to just create code files that you can send directly to a Python interpreter to run on your local machine. This is difficult to do in a word processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my suggestions, and some notes on each of them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; is probably the best beginner-friendly free text editor. It's available for all major operating systems. The one downside is that (for programmer-laziness reasons that I'll explain below in case you're curious) it tends to be a big battery drain, so I wouldn't leave it running outside of class/without plugging in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; is Microsoft's version of Atom---they're extremely similar (I suspect including similar battery drain problems, though, because of my visceral hatred of all things Microsoft I haven't used it for long enough to see myself), but some people prefer the one over the other. It's also totally cross-platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Mac users only, &lt;a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/"&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent text editor with a free and a paid version, where the free version works totally fine for any uses you'll need. There's also &lt;a href="https://www.sublimetext.com"&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; which is actually by far the best Mac-specific editor (in my opinion), but is not free---it costs something like 70 bucks, although they will let you use it without paying so long as you're willing to put up with period annoying nag message pop-ups. Many people also use &lt;a href="https://macromates.com"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;, but I've never tried it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Windows-specific applications, most people seem to recommend &lt;a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org"&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; which is free. I've never use it (though I think it's installed on some of our university computers), but it's very popular, so it's probably good. Apparently there's also a Sublime Text for Windows (which I just disovered); if it's stable it's doubtless amazing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you're using Linux, you probably already have a text editor you like; if not, talk to me or try &lt;a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit"&gt;Gedit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;explanation of the battery drain problem:&lt;/em&gt; a lot of programmers who don't want to write separate code for different operating systems use a cross-platform framework called &lt;a href="https://electronjs.org"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; to do it instead. Both Atom and VS Code are written in Electron. The problem with Electron is that it uses web browser technologies to get it to work on both platforms, so, essentially, it just runs a bunch of instances of Chrome in order to display documents. Chrome is a really heavy program that itself draws a ton of power, and Electron apps do it too.  Incidentally, Slack is also an Electron app, so if someone's made you use that and you've noticed it nuking your battery, that's why. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three problems on this set, one relatively small/easy one worth 20 points …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This problem set is worth 17.5% of the grade in this course. It is due on Friday, February 1, at 5pm, via a dropbox in ICON that I shall set up for the purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three problems on this set, one relatively small/easy one worth 20 points, and two large/difficult ones worth 40 points each; the large problems also contain alternative versions that can be done for half credit.  Subsequent problem sets will probably have more problems in them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to turn in this problem set&lt;/strong&gt;: each of the problems asks you to write a single Python function which carries out a designated operation.  You should include working code for each of these functions in a single Jupyter Notebook file, entitled &lt;code&gt;lastname_ps1.ipynb&lt;/code&gt; (obviously with your last name), which you will turn in to the dropbox on ICON.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each of the problems, you need not package all of your code in a single function. For example, you may write helper functions, import libraries outside of your function, etc.  However, you must turn in a single Jupyter Notebook file with all the code that makes your functions work as well as the functions themselves.  I expect to be able to run all the cells in the notebook you turn in, and, at the end, have a working function for each problem, so that I can call those functions with appropriate input and get the correct result. In all cases, your functions should return &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if they receive inappropriate input. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HONOR CODE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each student must agree to the following honor code; if you do not agree to this honor code, do not turn in this problem set and drop the course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will not solicit, receive, or provide any unauthorized assistance on this or any problem set in this course. I understand that unauthorized assistance includes seeing the work of any other student, including code, calculations, data analysis, or answers to problems. Students are permitted to discuss their general strategies for solving problems with one another, help one another understand lesson material or documentation for Python libraries, and the like, or other conversation short of sharing actual answers, calculations, data analysis, or code. Students are not permitted to seek or receive assistance or advice whatsoever from any person not enrolled in this course---this prohibition includes asking for help on public online forums such as stackoverflow.com, although students are free to search such websites and learn from preexisting discussions in which they are not participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I have any doubt about the permissibility of any kind of assistance, I will seek a ruling from the professor. I will report any violations of this honor code of which I am aware. Violating this honor code is grounds for immediate disenrollment from this course, or other sanctions as provided for by College of Law and University policy on academic dishonesty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 1 (20 points): Rock, Paper, Scissors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a function named &lt;code&gt;rps&lt;/code&gt; that plays rock, paper, scissors with a human.  It should first select randomly between rock, scissors, and paper, keeping that selection secret, then ask the user for input (no cheating and doing it the other way around!). After the user provides the appropriate input, it should decide who won or if there's a tie by the standard means (rock beats scissors beats paper beats rock) and reveal both its choice and the winner to the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules and definitions for this problem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rps must accept input in uppercase, lowercase, and any weird mixed-up case the user types in, it must also accept input with any number of spaces before or after the word. For example, all of the following are acceptable input:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rock
Rock
ROCK
            rock
rOcK
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the user tries to enter anything other than rock, paper, or scissors, it should print the message &lt;code&gt;"Please enter rock, paper, or scissors."&lt;/code&gt; and then ask the user for input again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response must be of the form &lt;code&gt;"I picked [rock/paper/scissors]. [You/I/Nobody] won!"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example correct input and output:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(arrow symbols designate things the computer prints out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;rps()
# computer picks rock in the background
-&amp;gt; Pick rock, paper or scissors!
# User types in &amp;quot;rocK    &amp;quot;
-&amp;gt; I picked rock. Nobody won!

rps()
# computer picks paper in the background
-&amp;gt; Pick rock, paper or scissors!
# User types in &amp;quot;Scissors&amp;quot;
-&amp;gt; I picked paper. You won!

rps()
# computer picks rock in the background
-&amp;gt; Pick rock, paper or scissors!
# User types in &amp;quot;sledgehammer&amp;quot;
-&amp;gt; Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.
# User types in &amp;quot;hand grenade&amp;quot;
-&amp;gt; Please enter rock, paper, or scissors.
# User types in &amp;quot;  scissors &amp;quot;
-&amp;gt; I picked rock. I won!
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Problem 2 (40 points): Date Calculator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure specifies a procedure for calculating the various dates (like the date to file a reply to a complaint) under the rules. Reduce that procedure to code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, write a function, named &lt;code&gt;calculate_days&lt;/code&gt;, that takes two parameters: &lt;code&gt;num_days&lt;/code&gt; which is the number of days to count, and &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; which is the date to begin counting from (for example, the date from which a complaint is served, triggering the clock for a reply). It should return the correct due date under FRCP 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules and definitions for this problem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; should have a default value of the current date when the script is run, in the time zone of the computer on which it is run. I should, in other words, be able to call &lt;code&gt;calculate_days(10)&lt;/code&gt; and get a FRCP 6-compliant date ten days from the date on which I call the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dates should be passed into the function as strings in the form MM-DD-YYYY, for example, &lt;code&gt;"12-27-2017"&lt;/code&gt;.  It should output dates as strings in plain English in a form like &lt;code&gt;"Tue, January 02, 2018"&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your calculation needs to take into account weekends and federal holidays that have a fixed date (New Years, Christmas, Veterans Day, and Independence day). It does not need to take into account holidays that have a weird date like "the fourth Monday in March" or whatever (e.g. Memorial Day, Thanksgiving). Also, it doesn't need to take into account "observed" holidays, for example, federal workers getting Monday off if Veterans Day happens to fall on a Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you can receive five bonus points for correctly handling floating holidays like Memorial Day, and another 5 bonus points for correctly handling holidays where the statute says that if it falls on a Sunday it's observed on a Monday/if it falls on a Saturday, it's observed on a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hint:&lt;/em&gt; look into the built-in Python library &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;. There are lots of tutorials about how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example correct input and output:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;calculate_days(3, "01-16-2019")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;Mon, January 21, 2019&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;calculate_days(19, "06-15-2019")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;Fri, July 05, 2019&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Half credit version of problem 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may write a version of &lt;code&gt;calculate_days&lt;/code&gt; that does not take into account weekends and holidays for half credit.  The half credit version also does not need to provide output in precisely the format specified above, although it should still output a string that is recognizably a date and is comprehensible to an ordinary lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 3 (40 points): Cite Finder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a function, named &lt;code&gt;cite_finder&lt;/code&gt;, that takes one parameter, &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt;, a string with a citation to an Illinois Supreme Court case, and returns the following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.  &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, if the citation does not correspond to an actual case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. An empty list, if the citation corresponds to an actual case, but the text of that case does not include any citations to the U.S. Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C.  A Python &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; of unique U.S. Supreme Court citations that appear in the text of the case, if the citation corresponds to an actual case and the case contains any U.S. Supreme Court citation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules and definitions for this problem:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unique" means a citation to a specific case from a specific reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Citation to an Illinois Supreme Court case" means a string reflecting a citation to the official reporter of the Illinois Supreme Court, in the form &lt;code&gt;12 Ill. 345&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;12 Ill.2d 345&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"U.S. Supreme Court citation" means any full citation (not supra, id, etc.) from the official U.S. Supreme Court reporter as abbreviated &lt;code&gt;U.S.&lt;/code&gt;. Party names, years, and page numbers need not be included. Archaic citations (like to Cranch), S.Ct., and L.Ed. Citations should not be included. Subsequent cites/pin cites to a case of the form &lt;code&gt;123 U.S. at 456&lt;/code&gt; should not be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Text" of a case includes all opinions (majority, concurrence, dissent, etc.) but does not include syllabus or any other content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your function must use the &lt;a href="https://case.law"&gt;Caselaw Access Project (case.law) API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list must be sorted using Python’s built-in list sorting functionality with default options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each citation must appear only once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example correct input and output:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cite_finder("231 Ill.2d 474")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;['387 U.S. 136', '419 U.S. 102', '424 U.S. 1', '429 U.S. 252', '508 U.S. 520', '509 U.S. 43']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cite_finder("231 Ill.2d 475")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cite_finder("215 Ill.2d 219")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;['339 U.S. 594', '387 U.S. 136', '467 U.S. 837', '538 U.S. 803']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Half credit version of problem 3:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may get half credit on this problem by writing a function, called &lt;code&gt;justice_finder&lt;/code&gt;, which takes an Illinois Supreme Court citation as defined above and returns a list of every justice who wrote an opinion. This must also use the Caselaw Access Project API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example correct input and output for half-credit version: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cite_finder("231 Ill.2d 474")&lt;/code&gt; should return &lt;code&gt;['JUSTICE THOMAS', 'JUSTICE FREEMAN,']&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This is something that hard science people do all the time: it turns out that there are some kinds of problems that aren't solvable in a deductive, analytic kind of way, but if you can write a simulation of some of the broad influences on the problem, then you can sometimes get a good idea what's going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, John Conway's famous &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life"&gt;Game of Life&lt;/a&gt; can be understood as a representation of an evolutionary process and has been the object of tons of study via computer simulation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistics there are many many examples of simulation that actually help people learn more about data.  For example, there's a technique called the "bootstrap" that involves taking your data and generating synthetic samples from it via simulation, which statisticans can use to squeeze out more information from the original data.  There's also a wide array of techniques called &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method"&gt;Monte Carlo&lt;/a&gt; simulations in statistics that can be used to do freakishly powerful stuff. Simulation is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for our purposes in this class, the most useful thing about simulations is how they allow us to explore how probability affects real-world results. It turns out that a lot of truths in probability are very counterintuitive to our unaided imagines, but are really easy to simulate using a computer, and, due to a very happy mathematical fact called the law of large numbers (which we'll learn more about in the stats section of the course), as you repeat a probabilistic simulation a lot of times (which a computer can do very fast), you're likely, in many cases, to be able to observe behavior that reflects the aggregate behavior that we'd expect to see in the real world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example.  There's a very famous probability problem called "Monty Hall." I have some more details about it in a later lesson, but here's the crux of it. There was an old game show called "Let's Make a Deal" (Monty Hall was the host) and one the games they played involved presenting the contestant with three closed doors. Behind one of the door was a car, and behind the other two was a booby prize, like a goat or something. (I dunno, goats are cute, I'd be cool with that.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contestant would choose a door, and then Monty Hall would open one of the remaining doors not chosen by the contestant and reveal a goat.  Then Monty Hall would ask the contestant: do they want to change with their original door, or do they want to switch?  Then, after the contestant makes their final choice, Monty reveals what's behind the door they landed on, and the contestant gets the prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment, and think about the game.  Can you figure out a good strategy for it?  Should the contestant always stick with their original door?  Should they always switch?  Should they flip a coin?  Does it matter at all?  Think about it, and try to justify your answer.  I'll be back below...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone who hasn't seen this problem concludes that it doesn't matter---stick, switch, flip a coin, either way, you have a 1 in 3 chance of getting the car.  Actually, this is wrong---the correct strategy is to always switch to the last closed door after Monty opens a door with a goat. (But don't feel bad if you didn't realize that, like I said, almost nobody who doesn't know the problem realizes that, including math professors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you don't believe me.  This is really counterintuitive!  How can it possibly make a difference, we start the game with one goat and three doors?!!!?!??  Well, this is a probability problem, so we can simulate it---and taking a look at the results might convince you that maybe I'm telling you the truth after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some code to simulate the Monty Hall problem.  It uses object-oriented programming concepts; please see the lesson about object-orientation to understand what's going on here. It turns out that object-oriented programming, as a style of writing code, is really well suited to simulations, because you can do things like make a player and its strategies one class, and a round of the game another class, and then just have them interact in order to produce your result.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've added some comments to the code to make it a bit more readable, but I won't explain it line by line (maybe in class).  I want you to try to make sense of it, and then figure out how to run it.  (I'll post an explanation of how to run it after a few lines of whitespace.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a good way to run this code, at 10000 times per strategy, which should run very quickly and is highly likely to produce reports reflecting the underlying probabilities of winning.  As you can see if you run this code, switching is a much better strategy than sticking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;strategies = [&amp;quot;stick&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;switch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;random&amp;quot;]
for strategy in strategies:
    player = Player(strategy)
    game = MontySimulation(player)
    game.play(10000)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will talk about Monty Hall later on in the course, and I'll give you the mathematical reasoning behind the correct strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, while object-oriented programming is a good match for simulation, it isn't necessary. To prove it, here's &lt;a href="https://github.com/paultopia/math4ls/blob/master/montyhall/src/montyhall/core.cljs"&gt;another Monty Hall simulation&lt;/a&gt; I wrote a couple years in a programming language that doesn't even support object-oriented programming. The part that does the simulation actually comes out shorter than the example above (although the linked code also generates a webpage to see the simulation live, which you can &lt;a href="http://paul-gowder.com/montyhall/"&gt;play with here if you want&lt;/a&gt;). If you want to see what the same simulation looks like in another language, go check it out... I'll bet you can understand the broad outlines, even though you've never been exposed to the other language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the remainder of this class, I will liberally use simulation to demonstrate important concepts in probability and statistics. I encourage you to poke around in those simulations, change their assumptions (for example, can you figure out a way to change the rules of Monty Hall to change the player's optimal strategy?  If you can, simulate it to check!), and poke around the edges in order to get a feel for the knowledge they represent. I think you'll find that being able to dig your hands into a probability/statistics process will make it more understandable and intuitive than just looking at some mathematical proof. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the fact that the last problem set was a little too difficult, I've lightened this one up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 1 (60 points): Suspicious Persons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) is concerned about drug trafficking on the many international flights landing in Cedar Rapids Airport (CID) (humor me).  Accordingly, it consults the research, and develops a Drug Trafficker profile, which combines factors which have been shown to predict drug trafficking.  Let's call those factors &lt;em&gt;Seediness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sketchiness&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Shadiness&lt;/em&gt;. CBP officers identify Seediness, Sketchiness, and Shadiness with perfect accuracy, and Seediness, Sketchiness, and Shadiness are conditionally independent both on drug trafficking and the complement of drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the evidence available to the CBP: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an international traveler entering CID is carrying illegal drugs, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha %\)&lt;/span&gt; (alpha) of the time that person is also Seedy.  That is, out of every 100 people who are carrying drugs, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; of those people are Seedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an international traveler entering CID is carrying illegal drugs, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta %\)&lt;/span&gt; (beta) of the time that person is also Sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an international traveler entering CID is carrying illegal drugs, then &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\gamma %\)&lt;/span&gt; (gamma) of the time that person is also Shady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a person does not have drugs, then they are unlikely to be Seedy, Sketchy, or Shady---the probability of an international traveler entering CID being one of those things conditional on them not carrying illegal drugs is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\psi\)&lt;/span&gt; (psi). (To be completely clear: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Seedy|NotDrugs) = \psi\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Sketchy|NotDrugs) = \psi\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Shady|NotDrugs) = \psi\)&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of all international travelers entering CID, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu %\)&lt;/span&gt; (mu) have drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the CBP issues a directive to its border control agents at the Cedar Rapids airport.  Every international traveler entering CID who is Seedy, Sketchy, and Shady must be stopped and searched for drugs.  (It turns out this kind of nonsense is constitutional at borders.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.A&lt;/strong&gt; (20 points): Write a function, &lt;code&gt;search_results(...)&lt;/code&gt; which takes appropriate parameters based on the information above and computes the probability that a person who is stopped under the above-described CBP directive is carrying illegal drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.B&lt;/strong&gt; (20 points): Explain the math behind your function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.C.&lt;/strong&gt; (20 points): Now suppose Sketchiness is not conditionally independent of Shadiness given non-drug-carrying (it is still conditionally independent given drug-carrying). Would your calculation change?  Briefly explain why and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 2 (40 points): Benford's Law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a well-known empirical regularity according to which the first digits in people's real-world income tend to be predominantly lower---i.e., lots more 1s than 9s, and so forth. This is known as Benford's law, and it is often used to detect tax cheats, accounting fraud, and the like.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illustrate Benford's law with a simulation of randomly chosen U.S. incomes.  You should assume that income follows either a lognormal or an exponential distribution (both will work)  Show the resulting distribution of digits with an appropriate data visualization.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt;: You'll have to tweak the scale on either distribution in order to get it to an appropriate magnitude that represents typical U.S. incomes. Experiment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;bonus&lt;/em&gt; For more on Benford's law, see &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/05/30/the-simple-mathematical-law-that-financial-fraudsters-cant-beat/#53798c8e4612"&gt;this Forbes article&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010541"&gt;this academic article paper reporting a simulation study of different distributions&lt;/a&gt;.  If you interview for any job involving detecting financial fraud (IRS, SEC, etc.), you can probably make yourself look awesome by knowing about this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, we had an example problem involving figuring out the posterior probability of someone being drunk, given that they blew a positive result on a breathalyzer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place where we got stuck was when we were trying to do was calculate the probability of blowing a positive breathalyzer, i.e., &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(blew)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  But all we had was the true positive rate, i.e., the probability that the machine would produce a positive result conditional on someone being drunk &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(blew|drunk)\)&lt;/span&gt; and the false positive rate, i.e., the probability that the machine would produce a positive result conditional on someone being sober &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(blew|sober)\)&lt;/span&gt;, as well as the prior probability of being drunk &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((.1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We needed &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(blew)\)&lt;/span&gt; because it is the denominator in our Bayes Rule calculation. Here's Bayes Rule again: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were trying to calculate &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(drunk|blew)\)&lt;/span&gt; and, per Bayes rule, that means we need to know the overall probability of a positive result (that's A here). Plugging in our terms, we were trying to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(drunk|blew) = \frac{P(blew|drunk)P(drunk)}{P(blew)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I asserted to you is that we can use the following calculation to go from what we know to the denominator of that equation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(blew) = P(blew|drunk) \cdot P(drunk) + P(blew|sober) \cdot P(sober)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known as the law of total probability. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability#Example"&gt;Wikipedia gives another good example&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a hopefully-more intuitive explanation of why you should believe this.  What we're really doing is partitioning the world.  You can only be drunk or sober, right?  You can't be drunk AND sober, and you can't be neither drunk nor sober.  Drunkenness and soberness are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what that means is that there are only two ways to blow a positive breathalyzer.  You can either blow a breathalyzer when you're drunk, or you can blow a breathalyzer when you're sober. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what we're asking is for the union of those two events, the "or" question.  The question "what's the probability of blowing a positive breathalyzer test" is just "what's the probability of blowing a positive breathalyzer test and being drunk, OR blowing a positive breathalyzer test and being sober."  And we know those have to be mutually exclusive events (because, yet again, can't be drunk and sober at the same time), so we know that we just add them up.  The addition rule gets us to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(blew) = P(blew \cap drunk) + P(blew \cap sober)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so how do we calculate those?  Well, let's reason through it.  What's the probability of both being drunk and blowing a positive result?  Well, it's gotta be lower than the probability of being drunk (because the probability of A and B always has to be lower than the probability of A alone, or identical to it in the pathological case where the probability of B is 1). The trick is to realize that conditional probabilities encode the information "given that I know A happened, what's the probability of B."  So it stands to reason that if you want to know whether A and B happened, you'd be interested in the probability of A, as well as the conditional probability of B given A.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what, in the earlier reading, I called "the expanded multiplication rule.  The formula is as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remind you, here's what I said in the first reading to explain this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic example to understand the reasoning behind the expanded multiplication rule is drawing cards. If you draw cards from a normal deck and don't put them back, then the probability of the first card being a heart is just 13/52 = 1/4. What's the probability of drawing a second heart?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, imagine that instead of drawing from the same deck, someone just gave you a second deck of cards with 51 cards in it, 12 of which were hearts. We know the probability of drawing a heart in that second deck, right? 12/51. That world is just the world described by the conditional probability of drawing a second heart given that you've already drawn a first. So what's the probability of drawing a heart out of the normal deck and a heart out of the weird second deck? Easy: 1/4 * 12/51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gets us as far as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  And, it should be obvious that  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A)\)&lt;/span&gt; ("A and B" is the same as "B and A"). If we substitute "drunk" and "sober" for A in the two sides of our addition, and substitute "blew" for B, then, by plugging in, we can conclude that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(blew) = P(blew|drunk) \cdot P(drunk) + P(blew|sober) \cdot P(sober)$$&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, please turn in your answers in a single notebook, emailed to Diana Dewalle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 1 (55 Points): Legislative Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go onto google scholar and find Daniel M. Butler &amp;amp; David E. Broockman, "Do Politicians Racially Discriminate Against Constituents? A Field Experiment on State Legislators" 55 American Journal of Political Science 463 (2011). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.A&lt;/strong&gt; (20 Points):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explain their results in plain english.  What were their methods?  What did they find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.B&lt;/strong&gt; (15 Points):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast their methods to the methods used by the  Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council (MMFHC) in &lt;em&gt;United States v. Balistrieri&lt;/em&gt;, from our week 7 readings, to check for discrimination.  Identify at least one advantage and one disadvantage (in terms of reliably identifying discrimination if it exists and not identifying discrimination if it doesn't exist) that the Butler/Broockman method has relative to the MMFHC method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem 1.C&lt;/strong&gt; (20 Points):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt to replicate some of their core results. Their dataset is on our class server as &lt;code&gt;Butler_Broockman_AJPS_2011_public_csv.csv&lt;/code&gt;  Notes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't be able to replicate any of the results from the appendix, because privacy rules kept them from sharing the data from the control variables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the paper isn't terribly clear on what statistical tests they used to generate the p values in the tables. Come up with your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't by any means need to replicate &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of their results.  I'll be satisfied if you plausibly use the data provided to convince a reader that the main findings of the paper (as you defined them in sub-problem A) are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem 2 (45 Points): Faculty Discrimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the dataset &lt;code&gt;prof_sex_discrim.csv&lt;/code&gt; from our class server.  It's a dataset of "faculty in a small midwestern college" allegedly from a sex discrimination case. (The dataset is swiped from a classic text, Weisberg, &lt;em&gt;Applied Linear Regression&lt;/em&gt;, and from a professor at Princeton, Germán Rodríguez, who made the data available online. The columns should be fairly self-descriptive---it's all faculty who are tenured or on the tenure track, and there are variables for salary, rank, years in rank, years since degree, and whether they have a doctorate or just a masters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want you to explore this dataset in a fairly open-ended fashion to see whether you can make any conclusions about the presence of sex discrimination.  Here are the rules: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use at least one data visualization, and you have to explain, in words, what you see.  The more informative, the more points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use at least one statistical test, and you have to explain, in words, why that statistical test makes sense as a way to tell whether this school is discriminating.  Again, the more informative, the more points.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify at least one potential problem with the statistical analysis you ran, and explain why, given the data you have (as identified by visualization or exploratory data analysis), this problem should worry you. Suggest at least one technique you might use to alleviate or avoid this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of those rules is worth 1/3 of the points for this problem (15 points).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="psets"></category></entry><entry><title>Using libraries in Python</title><link href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/using-libraries-in-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Paul Gowder</name></author><id>tag:sociologicalgobbledygook.com,2018-10-03:/using-libraries-in-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Programming would be incredibly time consuming if you couldn't reuse code.

&lt;p&gt;Well …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Programming would be incredibly time consuming if you couldn't reuse code. You've seen the basic form of code reuse already---the function, which allows you to lock up a transformation from some data to some other data, give it a name, and then apply it repeatedly, and to arbitrary data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it would also be super time-consuming if you couldn't use other people's code. There are many &lt;em&gt;libraries&lt;/em&gt; (also called "packages" or "modules," but note that these terms can &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19198166/whats-the-difference-between-a-module-and-a-library-in-python"&gt;be a little ambiguous&lt;/a&gt;) in Python that represent useful code written by other people.  Many of them are built into the standard distribution of Python---indeed, a lot of the reason that Python is such a popular programming language is that it comes with a lot of libraries, it's what's called a "batteries included" language. But you can get lots of libraries that aren't included with Python as well, from the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org"&gt;Python Package Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use a library, you have access to the variables it provides (and the stuff those variables point to). For example, a library might provide specialized kinds of data, like a string containing information about the version of Python you're using. It might provide functions that you can call. It might even provide classes (we'll talk about those later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use a library, you must &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward way to import a library is to just type &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; then its name.  For example, suppose you wanted to find out what the current working directory is?  (The current working directory is the directory on your hard drive that Python thinks you're "in," for example, where it will save files generated by your code if you don't specify another location.). Well, if you &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html"&gt;the documentation for that library&lt;/a&gt;, you will see that the built-in &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; library provides a function called &lt;code&gt;getcwd()&lt;/code&gt; which gives you the name of the current working directory.  So you'd run the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you may have guessed, when you import a library, it creates what's known as a &lt;em&gt;namespace&lt;/em&gt;---what that means is that you can't just refer what it provides by the name of the variable (or "name") on its own. You have to preface it by putting the name of the library and a period.  This is a good thing. Otherwise, you could accidentally overwrite names that you've used somewhere else, or names that Python provides in the standard library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; module provides a function called &lt;code&gt;load()&lt;/code&gt; that allows you to load files in JSON format and turn them into Python data that your code can use. But, as you might imagine, "load" is a pretty common name, and other libraries might use it as well. If it wasn't for the namespacing functionality, if you imported the &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; library you couldn't use any other library providing a function with the name "load," because when you imported &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; it would overwrite whatever any other library had assigned to that name. This would be pretty bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don't want to refer to a function (or string, or whatever) from within its namespace?  Well, then you can import it into a global namespace like this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;from [library] import [name]&lt;/code&gt; form just imports the specified names from a module directly into the global namespace. What this means is that &lt;code&gt;getcwd()&lt;/code&gt; will become available to you without prefacing it with the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; namespace... but no other names from the &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; library will be available, just the specific one you chose to import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You could import all the names in the library into the global namespace with &lt;code&gt;from os import *&lt;/code&gt; but that's usually a terrible idea that will lead to all sorts of bugs in your code.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also rename libraries on import. For example, you might do this if a library has a really long name that's hard to type or you want to rename it to something you'll remember more easily. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;library_with_the_cwd_function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;library_with_the_cwd_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is something that people in the data science world do a lot for some reason. People import the &lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; library as &lt;code&gt;np&lt;/code&gt; by convention, for example, and &lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt; gets imported as &lt;code&gt;pd&lt;/code&gt;.  I don't know why this custom started, but it's pretty much universal among data types who use Python. (And Numpy and Pandas are both super important, so you'll be seeing this a lot.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want, you can also rename specific names, as in: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;getcwd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;working_directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;working_directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Further reading on importing: this &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-modules-in-python-3"&gt;Digital Ocean tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installing Libraries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn't have to install libraries in this course if you've followed the instructions I've given. Both Azure Notebooks and the Anaconda distribution contain all the libraries that we will be using.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you do want to dig into Python programming further and need to install libraries down the road, here are some tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the Anaconda distribution comes with a command line program called "conda."  You can install lots of libraries from the special Anaconda package repository with &lt;code&gt;conda install [libraryname]&lt;/code&gt; at the package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard program to install things is called "pip."  Again, &lt;code&gt;pip install [libraryname]&lt;/code&gt; at the command line will do you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common and very obnoxious problem that happens with libraries is having incompatible versions of multiple libraries that need to work together. Usually, to avoid this, Python programmers create what's known as virtual environments, collections of libraries that live together and don't talk to other environments on their machines. This is way beyond the scope of the course (and the ecosystem of tools to do it changes rapidly), but if you get into using a bunch of packages, you should really look into doing this, or you'll get yourself into a mess sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should usually be careful installing libraries that you don't have confidence in (aren't widely known, etc.). They might execute malicious code. This is a security problem that a lot of people are worrying about, and it's actually been a problem a few times---most recently in a library for the JavaScript programming language, which got millions of downloads and then &lt;a href="https://snyk.io/blog/malicious-code-found-in-npm-package-event-stream/"&gt;got caught stealing bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. So be careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

In this first week, we will have a basic introduction to Python and to the fundamentals of computer programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get started programming, we have to set up a system to write our code and get the computer to read it. Most introductory Python texts, including the texts we'll be working with, ask you to install an "interpreter"---a program on your own computer that can read and execute Python code. We won't be doing that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, all your code will run in the cloud. We'll be using a free service by Microsoft called &lt;a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/"&gt;Azure Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;. This service will let you type in and execute your code online, through your web browser. This has some very large advantages: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't have to install anything locally, which can be problematic (especially for Windows users), and I don't have to try to debug your local installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Azure Notebooks runs on notebook software called &lt;a href="http://jupyter.org/"&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; which is built for data analysis (all the cool data scientist kiddos use it), so it has lots of nice facilities for exploring data and code incrementally, visualizing data, displaying tables, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I will ask you to make use of the free &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; service to "clone" (copy) assignments, which will be in notebook files that you can just run on Azure, as well as to turn those assignments in. Also, you will sign up for &lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com"&gt;DataCamp&lt;/a&gt;, I've set up free access for the duration of the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll get set up with all this stuff on the first day of class. &lt;strong&gt;Please bring a computer to class every day&lt;/strong&gt;.  Macs, Windows computers, and Linux computers will all work fine (though if you're a Linux user, you might be too advanced for this class).  We can make Chromebooks work too if need be. Anything else, talk to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Advanced user note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Azure Notebooks environment can be slow and a little awkward. It's better for beginners than installing Python locally, because of issues different operating systems and occasionally causing conflicts with other versions of things.  However, if you want to install locally, here's what you should use: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;a href="https://www.anaconda.com"&gt;Anaconda Python distribution&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system.  This is important: you want to use the &lt;strong&gt;Python 3.7&lt;/strong&gt; version of the installer, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Python 2.7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to do this, I'll help as much as I can, but you should know how to use the command line for your operating system. If you use Windows, I won't be able to help you as much as if you use a Mac or Linux. For Windows users, you might try setting up the Windows Subsystem for Linux and installing Anaconda through the instructions &lt;a href="https://medium.com/hugo-ferreiras-blog/using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-for-data-science-9a8e68d7610c"&gt;in this article&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't promise this will work. For Chromebook users, you probably won't be able to install Python locally unless you have a Pixelbook or some other &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Crostini/wiki/getstarted/crostini-enabled-devices"&gt;Chromebook that supports Crostini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In additional to installing Python, you'll probably want a good development-quality text editor if you get into programming outside of Jupiter notebooks. I recommend &lt;a href="https://atom.io"&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com"&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;, both of which should work on Mac, Windows, or Linux. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exploratory data analysis&lt;/em&gt; is just looking at data to see what you see.  We will spend some time, for example, looking at how to see the shape of data and what that can tell you about the world, how to shape investigations with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the heavy stuff all falls under the rubric of &lt;em&gt;statistics&lt;/em&gt;---and my hope is to convince you by the end of the course that it needn't be quite so heavy as lawyers have traditionally feared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the point of statistics?  There are really two points to statistics: first, to allow us to quantify our confidence in our understanding of reality, and second, to help us tease out cause and effect. Let's motivate our exploration of statistics with a few examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You Be the Scientist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, suppose you're a scientist and you think you've invented a cure for the common cold. How do you test it and make sure it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might start by experimenting on yourself. That has a pretty long tradition in science, actually---&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/themes/marie-and-pierre-curie-and-the-discovery-of-polonium-and-radium/"&gt;Marie and Pierre Curie&lt;/a&gt;, for example, experimented on themselves to learn about how radiation worked (and suffered very severe radiation poisoning as a result). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, if you're going to take on the risk of hurting yourself,  you should be sure that you're learning something as a result! Suppose you take the drug, and then you get well the next day. You might conclude that the drug cured you, but it could also just be that the cold was about to run its natural course. The drug could have done nothing... or it could have even made it worse---maybe if you hadn't taken it, you would have gotten better that evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that you'd really like to know how quickly you would have gotten better if you hadn't taken the medicine. But you can never know that, because you did take the medicine. We can never see the &lt;em&gt;counterfactual&lt;/em&gt; case of what would have happened if we had done something different. That inability has spawned countless speculative takes on history: what would have happened if Japan had never attacked Pearl Harbor and brought America into the war? Would we all be speaking German? Nobody can know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you decide to try the next best thing: your old college roommate also has a cold, and, as you learned from your undergraduate days, you're pretty good at talking your poor roommate into doing dumb things. So you decide, he'll take the medicine, and you'll go untreated, and you'll see who gets well faster. This is a scientific experiment, and you're the control group.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, it's a pretty lousy scientific experiment. How do you know that you and your friend don't heal at different paces? Or maybe s/he took some other medicine beforehand and, not wanting to disappoint you, didn't report that fact? Maybe being the kind of person who is willing to participate in someone's wild-west-style science experiment also makes you more likely to heal faster (something about stress and cortisol levels, perhaps). What you should have done was recruit a bunch of other participants, and then randomly assign some of them to a treatment group and some to a control group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discipline of statistics will guide our hypothetical scientist in designing that experiment and evaluating its results. For example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recruiting a large number of experimental participants and delivering treatment to them is difficult, expensive and potentially risky (what if our drug turns out to have nasty side effects). We'd like to recruit as few people as possible in order to get reliable results. The discipline of &lt;em&gt;statistical power analysis&lt;/em&gt; can tell us how many people we need to recruit in order to be able to detect the effect we think we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose we see an effect. People who take the medicine get well, on average, a day faster than people who don't. How do we tell if that's a real effect, as opposed to just a coincidence based on idiosyncratic properties of the group of people who we happened to recruit? We use statistical tools like &lt;em&gt;hypothesis testing&lt;/em&gt; in order to figure out how confident we can be that the results we see represent a real biological phenomenon (although we can never be completely confident). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Experiments in the Law&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that experimental research can be involved in building a legal case as well. The example I like best (partly because of my own history as a civil rights lawyer) is discrimination testing. This is a technique that investigators use in a number of contexts, perhaps most prominently in the housing context. The &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/fair-housing-testing-program-1"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/periodicals/em/spring14/highlight3.html"&gt;nonprofit fair housing organizations&lt;/a&gt; often use testing to investigate claims of housing discrimination. (You may have been introduced to the concept of discrimination testers in your Professional Responsibility class, in the course of discussing the controversial disciplinary case &lt;a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/oregon/supreme-court/2000/s45801.html"&gt;In re Gatti&lt;/a&gt;, 8 P.3d 966 (Ore. 2000) (under Oregon professional responsibility rules, lawyer may not misrepresent identity for the purposes of conducting investigation into alleged wrongdoing), which was seen as a potential threat to the practice of discrimination testing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's roughly how housing discrimination testing works: suppose there's reason to believe that an apartment complex discriminates against African-American rental applicants, say, by telling every African-American tenant that there are no vacancies. The investigating organization sends a white couple and an African-American couple, who are trained to behave similarly in other relevant respects, to inquire about apartments. If the two couples are given different information about the existence of vacancies, the organization concludes that it must be because of their race---and has concrete evidence of illegal discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that you may have noticed is that I did not describe a large-scale study in the last paragraph. Indeed, these testing organizations typically use numbers of testers that would be unlikely to support a statistically generalizable result (they tend to operate on tight budgets). Yet (as we will discuss in more detail later on) that does not mean that this evidence is not relevant or persuasive. For example, the court in &lt;a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/156/413/2318127/"&gt;United States v. Garden Homes Mgmt., Corp.&lt;/a&gt;, 156 F. Supp. 2d 413 (D.N.J. 2001) rejected a motion for summary judgment, holding that the evidence of three paired tests like those described above was sufficient to create an issue of fact on whether or not the defendant maintained a practice of discrimination. As the court said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While, in the abstract, three fair housing tests might not necessarily reflect Defendants' rental practices, the tests at issue are particularly probative. They all occurred within one month and yielded virtually identical results. The timing and uniform results of these tests give rise to a permissible inference that racial discrimination is not a sporadic event but, instead, is part of the way that Defendants do business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways we might interpret this. We might think that juries are entitled to make their own inferences about the evidence independent of the way that a statistician would think about it, or we might think---as the court seemed to suggest in &lt;a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071702564fsupp2d113811598"&gt;Southern California Housing Rights Center v. Krug&lt;/a&gt;, 564 F.Supp.2d 1138 (C.D., Cal., 2007)---that the behavior exhibited by landlords in these tests are themselves acts of discrimination in violation of the Fair Housing Act, independent of the fact that no tester actually intended to rent. See generally &lt;a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/455/363/"&gt;Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman&lt;/a&gt;, 455 U.S. 363 (1982) (tester has independent right to accurate information, sufficient to support standing under Fair Housing Act). At any rate, we will discuss this further down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From Experiments to Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistical evidence of discrimination will actually be a big theme of this course. (It's one of the most prominent and interesting ways in which statistics is used in the law.) However, most of the statistical evidence we see in the law is what's known as &lt;em&gt;observational&lt;/em&gt;---rather than randomly assigning people to treatment and control groups, or otherwise controlling the delivery of the treatment to people. (Indeed, even the housing tests probably can't be seen as randomized controlled trials in the fullest sense as the ideal from experimental science, as race cannot be randomly assigned to people---although we do have scientific studies where researchers have managed to come close to that, such as &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561"&gt;a famous study&lt;/a&gt; where resumes with stereotypically racialized names were sent to employers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a number of cities have filed lawsuits against mortgage lenders, alleging that they engaged in discrimination by steering borrowers of color to higher interest-rate loans. These cities have not (as far as I know) conducted tests by, for example, sending applicants of different races in to apply for loans. Rather, they've conducted a statistical analysis of the terms of the loans offered in their communities, and filed lawsuits on the basis of a disparity across races---finding that borrowers of color typically ended up with worse loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worry about such statistical evidence is that it might be &lt;em&gt;confounded&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;omitted variables&lt;/em&gt;. This is just a fancy stats-person way of saying what we said before about the medical test. Suppose that the city filing the suit has a lot of racial segregation and concentrated poverty---it might be the case that the victims of that segregation get worse loan terms because they've suffered financial disadvantage affecting their creditworthiness, not because of intentional discrimination by the lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As alternative to randomization (also known as "experimental controls"), researchers use "statistical controls" to try to solve this problem. We will spend a lot of time on statistical controls in this course, so here's just a taste now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine an &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/621"&gt;Age Discrimination in Employment Act&lt;/a&gt; lawsuit, in which the plaintiff alleges that during layoffs at a firm, older workers had a substantially higher chance of being let go. Just such a lawsuit has recently &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/17/laid-off-older-workers-file-age-discrimination-complaint-against-ibm/EsCuULOUfUpZjxK5er2y8L/story.html"&gt;been filed against IBM&lt;/a&gt;. 
In such a lawsuit, the employer will invariably claim that the older workers aren't being fired because of their ages---rather, they'll claim that, for example, the company choose to retain workers with more relevant skills, and if that happened to fall harder on older workers, it's just because they failed to keep their skills up to date. (This seems to be IBM's basic defense in the noted suit.) How should the plaintiff's lawyer use statistics to try to prove their case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one tool they might try. You'll probably remember the equation for a line from your high school geometry classes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$y=ax+b$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to refresh your memory: you can graph a line by starting at b, the intercept, and then just getting the rest of the points from that formula, i.e., when the point is at 1 on the x axis, it's at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a + b\)&lt;/span&gt; on the y axis, when it's at 2 on the x axis, it's at &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2a+b\)&lt;/span&gt; on the y axis, and so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In statistics, we can go the other way: we can take a bunch of data and try, using mathematical techniques that we'll look at later, to find the line that best describes it. This is easier to think about when the y axis takes on more than two values, so let's think of it as salary (for a moment) rather than whether someone was fired or not. Also, let's follow the conventions of statistics and put the intercept first, plus sneak some Greek letters in there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if plaintiff is claiming that the older an employee is, the lower a raise they got last year, then we can collect a dataset of all the employees and their raises, and then set the percentage raise last year to be y and the employee's age to be x.  Then we can use those mathematical techniques that I just hinted at (patience!) to find the &lt;em&gt;regression line&lt;/em&gt; that best fits the data.  That means finding estimates for the &lt;em&gt;coefficients&lt;/em&gt; alpha and beta in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$y = \alpha + \beta x$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If beta is negative, that suggests that older workers are indeed getting smaller raises. Then we can use more statistical techniques which we will learn to discern whether it is negative enough to be &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt;---to give us confidence that lower raises are genuinely due to age rather than to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  The employer still has that argument about skills and such. It turns out that regression analysis allows us to take account of those arguments. Let's say that an employee's level of skill is represented by how many training courses they took last year. What we really want to do is compare apples to apples---to compare older employees who took, say, 10 training courses last year to younger employees who took 10 courses, and older employees who took 9 courses to younger employees who took 9 courses, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you can extend our equation to draw a line to include more x variables. So let's say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_1\)&lt;/span&gt; is the employee's age, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_2\)&lt;/span&gt; is the number of training courses the employee took last year.  Then we can find the best values of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta_2\)&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha\)&lt;/span&gt; in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that (subject to some caveats and pitfalls on which we shall spend some time), the value of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\beta_1\)&lt;/span&gt; will be a good estimate of the effect of age on pay raises &lt;em&gt;holding the number of training courses constant&lt;/em&gt;---so it gives us the apples-to-apples comparison we're looking for. And, within some limits, we can keep adding variables as the employer comes up with more and more excuses for the lower salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we'll be spending quite a bit of time on regression analysis, this is just a taste for now. You will hopefully be able to see that being able to make sense of these concepts will help you in your practice. This is just an introduction, we'll dig in much deeper in the weeks to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first week of the course, we're going to cover some core concepts of computer programming. With this, we will build a foundation to do more interesting things in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="What-is-Computer-Programming?"&gt;What is Computer Programming?&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-Computer-Programming?"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers basically just do one thing: they complete very simple operations at astonishing speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you wanted to calculate the thousandth number of the &lt;a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html"&gt;Fibonacci Sequence&lt;/a&gt; --- the sequence of numbers such that starts with 0 and 1, and then each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't go on until you are satisfied you know what the next number is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, it would take a fairly long time to calculate it by hand.  However, a computer can do it in less than a second. I'll show you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;digit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;first&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;digit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;the &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;digit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;the 1000th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: 26863810024485359386146727202142923967616609318986952340123175997617981700247881689338369654483356564191827856161443356312976673642210350324634850410377680367334151172899169723197082763985615764450078474174626

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is obviously not a number you would want to try to compute by hand, or even using a pocket calculator! (Incidentally, if you looked up a list of those numbers and found a different result, try comparing it to the 999th number. People seem to differ on whether to start counting from 0 or 1 in enumerating the Fibonacci sequence.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything that computers do---including the system you're reading this on right now---is built up by doing very simple ("primitive") operations many many times. The way it works is that programmers build those primitives---basic arithmetic operations and pushing things around in memory, basically---into more complicated pieces of functionality. Then the next programmer can use that complicated piece of functionality (often called an "abstraction") and build some of those up into something more complicated, and so on, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will start at a much higher level, but you'll learn to do that yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start by breaking down the Fibonacci sequence code above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;digit = 3
first = 0
second = 1
while digit &amp;lt; 1001:
    answer = first + second
    first = second
    second = answer
    digit += 1
print("the " + str(digit - 1) + "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: " + str(answer))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three lines are &lt;strong&gt;variable assignments&lt;/strong&gt; --- they give a name to some piece of data. In this case, we've given the name &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; to the number 3, and so forth. Once we give a name to some piece of data, we can refer to that name and get back that data---and we can change the data attached to the name as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's good to use descriptive names, so anyone else reading your code (or future you) can tell what you're trying to do.  Here, I used names meant to track exactly what we're doing: the  &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; starts at 3 because we start calculating at the third digit of the Fibonacci sequence (we know the first two already). Likewise, &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; represent the two numbers we need to add up to get the third.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;while digit &amp;lt; 1001:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 4th line starts a &lt;strong&gt;while loop&lt;/strong&gt;.  Remember how I said that computers are really good at doing the same thing over and over?  The most basic mechanism for doing so is the loop, which is just programmer-speak for "execute a list of instructions repeatedly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structure ("syntax") of the while loop in Python (it's different in other languages) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The keyword &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; at the start of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;em&gt;expression&lt;/em&gt; evaluating to a &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt; after that.  (I'll explain what the italicized terms mean in a moment.)  This is known as the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A colon at the end of the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An indented series of lines ("block") containing &lt;em&gt;statements&lt;/em&gt;, known as the "body" of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way it works is that each of the statements in the indented block will be executed in sequence so long as the condition is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the English translation of the Python &lt;code&gt;while digit &amp;lt; 1001:&lt;/code&gt; is "go look up the value of the &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; variable. So long as it is less than 1001, execute all the indented statements  that follow."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about some of those vocabulary words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, most of what you can write in Python can be divided into expressions and statements. Essentially (and I'm simplifying a bit here), an &lt;strong&gt;expression&lt;/strong&gt; is like algebra: it's a representation of some value, and its value can be substituted in for it. For example &lt;code&gt;1 + 1&lt;/code&gt; is an expression, and 2 can seamlessly be substituted in for it. We say that an expression &lt;strong&gt;evaluates&lt;/strong&gt; to its value: &lt;code&gt;1 + 1&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;while digit &amp;lt; 1001&lt;/code&gt; the &lt;code&gt;digit &amp;lt; 1001&lt;/code&gt; part is an expression. It evaluates to a special type of result, known as a &lt;strong&gt;boolean&lt;/strong&gt;.  In Python, the two boolean values are &lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;False&lt;/strong&gt; and they mean pretty much what you would expect them to mean. So &lt;code&gt;digit &amp;lt; 1001&lt;/code&gt; tells the computer "go look up the value of &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; and see if it's less than 1001. If so, replace the value of this expression by &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, replace it with &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statements&lt;/strong&gt; can be seen as instructions to the computer. They aren't meant to be evaluated to some value, but are meant to bring something about in the world inside the computer's head. We've seen a lot of statements already: the variable assignments we've looked at are all statements. They don't calculate anything, they just tell the computer "hold onto this name for this quantity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we wrote a line like &lt;code&gt;my_sum = 1 + 1&lt;/code&gt; we would have an expression and a statement. What happens is that first the expression &lt;code&gt;1 + 1&lt;/code&gt; is evaluated to 2, and then that value is assigned to the variable &lt;code&gt;my_sum&lt;/code&gt;.  We always read variable assignments right to left: evaluate all the stuff on the right side of the equals sign, and then assign whatever we get out of it to the name on the left side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, you can have a lot of expressions in a line --- you could say something like &lt;code&gt;weird_quantity = 5 * (9 + 28) * 2015 / 99&lt;/code&gt; and that's fine. Generally, you don't have more than one statement in a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, expressions do something (like statements do) in addition to evaluating to a value. Those are called &lt;em&gt;side-effects&lt;/em&gt; but don't worry about that for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's keep going!  You should be able to figure out what &lt;code&gt;answer = first + second&lt;/code&gt; means--- it assigns the variable &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; to the expression &lt;code&gt;first + second&lt;/code&gt;.  It looks up the values of &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; and sums them. You should see that &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; get the value 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two lines introduce one of the main reasons we use variables. As the name suggests, it's because they can &lt;em&gt;vary&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;first = second
second = answer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're reassigning our variables here!  Remember, we do variable assignment right to left. So what this means is "take the value currently attached to the name &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; and assign it to &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, then take the variable currently attached to the name &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; and assign it to &lt;code&gt;second.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how this works in terms of the first few digits of the Fibonacci sequence. Consider the following table, where the first row is the digit we're on (first, second, etc.) and the second row is the value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;\/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's imagine an arrow poing to the digit we're trying to sort out. So when we start, the arrow is pointing at 3 (the variable &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;), because we're trying to calculate the third digit. We calculate that digit by looking to the first number of the two immediately preceeding numbers (the variable &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, represented in the table by ^1), and adding it to the second number of the two immediately preceeding (the variable &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt;, represented in the table by ^2), giving us the total (variable &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're not done yet, because we still have 997 more numbers to calculate. So how do we calculate the 4th digit?  Well, we need to add the last two digits again... the number that used to be in the variable &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt; is the first digit we'll add the next time, and the current digit (variable &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt;) is the second one.  In order to tell the computer that's going to happen, we reassign those variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last line of our loop &lt;code&gt;digit += 1&lt;/code&gt; is a special syntax for &lt;em&gt;incrementing&lt;/em&gt; the value of a variable---it just says "replace the value of &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; with its own value plus 1." In our chart above, that just means moving the digit forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's a representation of out computer's memory at the start of the indented block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;\/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's a representation of out computer's memory at the end of the indented block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;\/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrow indicating what digit we're about to calculate has moved to the 4th place, and the arrows indicating what digits we're going to sum up have moved to the second and third, plus we've added an answer for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the magic of loops kicks in. Now that we're at the end of our indented block, the computer jumps back up to the start of the while loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it checks the condition again. Is &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; still less than 1001?  Yes, it is. It's 4 now, instead of 3, but that's lots less than 1001. So now, we go back into the body of the loop, this time using the new values of our variables!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another iteration of the loop, here's what the computer knows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;\/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it keeps doing that, again and again, moving the arrow up top each time, at blinding speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's think of what happens after it calculates the 1000th digit.  Here's where we are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;\/&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;lots&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;lots&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;^2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, when it goes back to the start of the loop, it tests the condition and finds that it's &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt; isn't under 1001 any more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, it jumps out of the while loop and goes to the next line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;print("the " + str(digit - 1) + "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is: " + str(answer))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This line calls the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function, which instructs the computer to print to the screen (not to a paper printer!) the expression inside the parentheses. (We'll talk about functions and what the parentheses do in a little bit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stuff inside the parentheses is a &lt;strong&gt;string&lt;/strong&gt;---that is, an piece of text that the computer represents in memory, made up of &lt;strong&gt;characters&lt;/strong&gt;.  Typically we tell Python to hold onto a string by surrounding it with quotes (single or double both work, but they have to match). These are called &lt;strong&gt;string literals&lt;/strong&gt;. Like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;my_sentence = "Hi, I am Gowder's sentence."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can also create strings out of expressions, and use them in other expressions. One of the neat things that you can do with strings is &lt;strong&gt;concatenate&lt;/strong&gt; them, that is, use the plus sign to sort of add them together, so that &lt;code&gt;"the cat " + "in the hat"&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;"the cat in the hat"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what that last line does is look up the last value that &lt;code&gt;answer&lt;/code&gt; got (which is the 1000th digit, because we haven't calculated the 1001th yet), convert that into a string with the &lt;code&gt;str()&lt;/code&gt; function (turning it from, e.g., &lt;code&gt;12345&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;"12345"&lt;/code&gt;---this matters!), does the same with &lt;code&gt;digit&lt;/code&gt;, and then concatenates them all together with the string literals there into one big string, which we print to the screen so that we can learn the answer to our math puzzle!&lt;/p&gt;

There are a couple more in this lesson, but, before you go onto the next one, try using a loop to calculate a different quantity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might remember from your early schooling, the factorial of a number, denoted n!, is the product of that number and all the positive integers before it. For example, 5! = 1x2x3x4x5 = 120&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next cell, use a loop to calculate 1000 factorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[&amp;nbsp;]:&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that a p-value is an attempt to quantify our degree of confidence in not having made a type I error (although &lt;a href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/p-values-and-bayes-rule.html"&gt;it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the probability of having made a type I error …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Statistical power is, in terms of practical use, kind of the flip side of a p-value.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that a p-value is an attempt to quantify our degree of confidence in not having made a type I error (although &lt;a href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/p-values-and-bayes-rule.html"&gt;it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the probability of having made a type I error&lt;/a&gt;), i.e., making a false positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, statistical power is about avoiding type II errors, that is, making false negatives. Often, it's said that the statistical power of a test 1 - the probability of making a type II error; equivalently, if a study has 80% power, it means that 80% of the time that we ought to be rejecting the null hypothesis, we do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From that description, we might think that calculating statistical power isn't very useful after we get a result---and that's generally right. The point of power analysis isn't to say "hey, we got a result, what's the chance of incorrectly rejecting the null."  Because power analysis depends on the sample size (among other things, more in a moment), the real point is to figure out what the sample size should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formally speaking, statistical power is a function of the effect size---the extent to which the treatment makes a difference in the null hypothesis (usually standardized into a measure called &lt;em&gt;Cohen's d&lt;/em&gt; to permit comparison across different studies), the number of observations, and alpha, or the significant level you're planning to use for your study. And it's an increasing function of all these things---that is, larger sample size = more power, larger effect size = more power, and higher significance level (if you're willing to accept p-values of 0.1 rather than 0.05) = more power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment and think about this. It's important to have an intuition for why this is true. Remember that when we're doing significance testing, we're asking the following question: &lt;em&gt;Is our data so radically different from what we'd expect under the null hypothesis that it's very unlikely we'd have seen it if the null hypothesis were true?&lt;/em&gt; And we capture that notion of being radically different in terms of standard deviations of the sampling distribution (aka standard errors): if our statistic in the data is lots of standard deviations away from the null hypothesis statistic, then it's a significant result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of power, then, just means "before I do the study, how likely is it that I'll see data lots of standard errors away from the mean in my sample, if there's a difference in the population?"  Well, let's reason through this. If we were omnipotent, what levers could we pull in order to change that likelihood? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could reduce the standard error. And since the standard error is the population standard deviation (estimated by the standard deviation of the sample) divided by the square root of the sample size, that means we need to increase &lt;em&gt;the sample size&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could increase the distance between the observed statistic and the null hypothesis mean, i.e., the &lt;em&gt;effect size&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could decrease the number of standard errors that count as "lots," a.k.a., the &lt;em&gt;significance level&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, these calculations can be found in the &lt;a href="http://www.statsmodels.org/dev/stats.html?highlight=power#module-statsmodels.stats.power"&gt;statsmodels.stats.power module&lt;/a&gt;. I won't give a formal calculation here, although we may talk about power with respect to particular tests and techniques elsewhere in the course. The conceptual framework is more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Underpoweredness: pervasive and terrible.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since messing around with significance levels is usually a bad idea in null hypothesis significance testing, the main way to increase power is to increase the sample size. But by how much?  This is where researchers get into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, it's hard to actually do power calculations in real life, because &lt;em&gt;you don't know what the true effect size out in the world is&lt;/em&gt;.  How can you know the true effect size? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a toy study: suppose you were testing the hypothesis that having a garage raises the price of a house. Seems pretty plausible, but by how much?  Does having a garage increase the price of the house by 10,000 dollars?  By 100,000 dollars?  By fifty cents? By 5% of the price? This is effect size. And you don't know it until after you've done the research (and, even then, only if it's correct). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many researchers in the real world over-estimate the power of their studies because they over-optimistically estimate their effect sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly relevant to survey and experimental research.  Carrying out this research can be super expensive, and so you need to know how many participants you need in order to have a realistic chance of seeing a result. Lots of research in fields like psychology is done with really small groups of participants, and this means that such studies tend to be &lt;em&gt;underpowered&lt;/em&gt;---this is not a good thing. Statistical power is also relevant to observational research, but the nice thing about observational research using things like census data is that sample sizes tend to be nice and big. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consumer of research, underpowered studies are quite bad, because they mean that more published research is likely to be garbage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see this, let's think about the problem informally in Bayesian terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there are two disciplines, highpower and lowpower.  Highpower customarily conducts studies with 80% power.  Lowpower customarily conducts studies with 20% power.  Both disciplines customarily find statistical significance with p=0.05.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's suppose the base rate of true findings in both fields is 10%.  That is, 10% of the things that researchers test in each field actually has a real effect.  And suppose that both fields conduct 10,000 studies. Finally, let's suppose that in both fields there's a very large &lt;em&gt;publication bias&lt;/em&gt;---research papers with negative findings are never published, and research papers with positive findings are always published.  (This is a bit harsh---there is a big publication bias problem, but it's probably not &lt;em&gt;quite that bad&lt;/em&gt;. But the simplifying assumption will be enough to do the work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In highpower, of those 10,000 studies, there will be 1000 true effects, and the researchers will find 800 of them. In addition, they'll find 500 false effects (type I errors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lowpower, by contrast, the researchers will only find 200 of the true effects. They'll find the same 500 false effects, because statistical power doesn't affect the false positive rate of an individual study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now you be a consumer of research from those two fields. In highpower, there's a 800/1300 = 62% chance of a given research publication being true. In lowpower, there's only a 200/700 = 29% chance of a given publication being true. So you can't really trust the stuff that shows up in the Journal of Lowerpower at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the studies that do get published are likely to over-estimate the sizes of even true effects.  Why?  Well, suppose the true effect size out there in the population for what you're studying is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi\)&lt;/span&gt;.  But random sampling error could mean that, in the sample for any given study, you could see an effect size of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi \pm \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.  The problem is that because your study is so underpowered, you're much less likely to detect the effect in samples where it's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi - \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; and much more likely when it's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\phi + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;. And publication bias kicks in again to mean that in the real research literature we're likely to see over-inflated effect sizes.  (And of course &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt; is basically going to be proportional to the sampling variance, so you can expect it to be bigger in the small samples that underpowered studies have anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sufficiently small effect sizes, it might even be the case that the sign of the effect could flip, i.e., you think that garages decrease the prices of houses when they really increase it (in our toy equation above suppose &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\epsilon &amp;gt; \phi\)&lt;/span&gt;?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something like this effect is doubtless a major contributor to problems like the replication crisis in psychology research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, however, let's make sure we have the right version of a library we need called Seaborn.  Run the code in the next block and make sure that you get the right version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;warnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filterwarnings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ignore&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__version__&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[1]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;0.9.0&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure that you have version 0.9.0 or higher as the output.  If you don't, the code in this lesson will not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a lower version (you might have 0.8.0) then start a new cell and run the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;!pip install seaborn --upgrade&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, when that finishes installing (the asterisk goes away), &lt;em&gt;delete that cell&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;em&gt;kernel -&amp;gt; restart and run all&lt;/em&gt; from the menus up above.  If everything worked ok, it should now say 0.9.0 or higher.  If not, consult with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're also going to import &lt;em&gt;Pandas&lt;/em&gt;, which is a very powerful library for reading and accessing tabular data (like spreadsheets); you can think of Pandas as souped-up Excel for programmers.  We will also import the built in &lt;em&gt;io&lt;/em&gt; library and the &lt;em&gt;Requests&lt;/em&gt; library for making requests from the internet; we'll see why in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This next block is a little gnarly.  What we're going to do is use the &lt;code&gt;get()&lt;/code&gt; function in the requests library to fetch a good learning dataset from another professor's class &lt;a href="http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary"&gt;this class, if you're curious&lt;/a&gt;, and then turn it into a Pandas DataFrame (fancy spreadsheet). There's a bit of messiness that you don't quite need to worry about in this---particularly, &lt;code&gt;read_fwf()&lt;/code&gt; is a pandas function to read from a file of fixed-width lines, and &lt;code&gt;StringIO&lt;/code&gt; is how Python tricks libraries to think that a string (the result of our http request) is a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an exercise, go and look up the Pandas documentation for how you'd read a CSV file, then go find a CSV file online and load it up to a Pandas dataset yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raw_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/salary.dat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_fwf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StringIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;raw_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just used the &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; method on our DataFrame, &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;, to see the first few rows of the data.  This is a great way to get a quick look at what the variables are in a dataset, what type they are, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: the formatting of these tables on the course website might not be amazing.  I'm working on it, and if you see this message, I may not yet have fixed it. You can always look in the course github repository for lessons too, where the formatting is a bit cleaner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One immediately annoying thing about this dataset is that the variables have terrible names.  Let's fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, obviously, this is a dataset about a theoretical gender discrimination in university employment problem, and one obvious thing we might want to know here is whether there's a gender disparity by rank: are higher ranking faculty in our dataset more likely to be one gender or another?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One classic exploratory tool to get a sense of whether this is true is known as a &lt;em&gt;crosstab&lt;/em&gt;. Basically, that's just a fancy name for a table---we might want to know how many assistant professors there are of each gender, associate professors, etc. That's pretty easy to do in Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of table is also known as a &lt;em&gt;contingency table&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;male&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;38&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;All&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;20&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;52&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see right away that there is a gender disparity. More than half of women are at the assistant (lowest) rank, while less than a third of men are there; men are more likely to be full professors (the highest rank) than anything else.  Note that this &lt;strong&gt;isn't evidence of discrimination&lt;/strong&gt;---after all, there might be some other reason for this disparity (and if this pattern didn't show up, it wouldn't be evidence of no discrimination).  To get serious evidence, we'll have to look at some of the things that we'll talk about in the statistics part of the course.  Nonetheless, it's always good to get a basic look at your data first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great way to understand what your data is all about is to use visualizations.  For this, we'll make use of the Seaborn library that we loaded up right at the beginning of this lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first visualization tool in our kit is the &lt;em&gt;histogram&lt;/em&gt;.  This allows us to visualize the &lt;em&gt;distribution&lt;/em&gt; of a single variable in our data---to see how much of our data takes different kinds of values.  Let's look at a histogram of the salary data in this set. In Seaborn, we do this with the &lt;code&gt;distplot()&lt;/code&gt; function (for reasons that are a bit obscure---almost every other library calls it "hist").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[10]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;distplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;salary&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[10]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x118766b00&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to see the rough shape of our data.  There are a bunch of salaries, it looks like, between 15,000 and 30,000-ish, and many fewer salaries above that.  (Ignore the line drawn through this plot for now, that's a fancy thing called a "kernel density estimate")&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should always start by looking at histograms of your variables of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gotcha with histograms is that the &lt;em&gt;bin size&lt;/em&gt; makes a big difference.  What a histogram does is chunks our data into groupings, each with the same size, and then makes a bar chart of those groups.  Seaborn has an algorithm that by default usually makes a pretty sensible selection, but it's always good to look at different bin widths---it can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the existing data, it looks like the default Seaborn algorithm chose 5 bins, which seems sensible, but let's change that and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a scatterplot, each observation is a dot, and the location of a dot is determined by its value on the two variables.  So it looks like on the whole, the further out from degree someone is, the higher their salary is. This is as to be expected---obviously, more experienced people get paid more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Discrete-vs-Continuous-variables"&gt;Discrete vs Continuous variables&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Discrete-vs-Continuous-variables"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that has been in the background of our lesson thus far is the difference between &lt;em&gt;categorical&lt;/em&gt; data, also known as &lt;em&gt;discrete&lt;/em&gt; data, and &lt;em&gt;numerical&lt;/em&gt; data, also known as "continuous" data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discrete data is, loosely speaking, data that takes a fixed number of values in your dataset. For example, in the dataset we're working with, gender only takes female and male, it's a discrete variable. Income, by contrast, is continuous because within its range, it could be anything.  (Of course, strictly speaking, this isn't true, because you can't pay people fractions of a penny, and in our data we only have whole dollars.  But it's close enough---these categories are kind of rough.) You could make salary discrete by putting it in &lt;em&gt;bins&lt;/em&gt; --- if we created categories like "under 20,000", "20,000-25,000" and so forth, we could &lt;em&gt;discretize&lt;/em&gt; that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This matters because different visualizations are more or less appropriate for different kinds of data.  For example, scatterplots where one of the variables is discrete tend to be pretty useless.  Take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That tells us something, but it doesn't tell us a whole lot!  The reason is because there just isn't enough variation in the sex variable to let us see meaningful associations with this plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you do then?  Well, one neat thing we can do is use color to add a categorical dimensions to a scatterplot.  Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That let us look at each datapoint and see the gender label attached to it!  So we can see, for example, that it sort of looks like women are more or less concentrated below men, that is, that at the same number of years since degree, it sort of looks like women tend to be paid less.  (We'll make "sort of looks like" much more precise when we learn about regression.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to read a boxplot is that the boxes shows the &lt;em&gt;interquartile range&lt;/em&gt;, or the middle 50% (i.e., the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile) of the distributions---in this case, of the distributions of salary by gender.  The whiskers (bars) at the ends show the full range of the dataset, except for extreme values ("outliers"), which are shown in dots above and below. The bars in the middle of the boxes represent the mean (average).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we can see that salaries for women, on the whole, tend to clump lower than men, except for one woman who is getting a much higher salary than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The histogram, scatterplot, and boxplot are the Big Three for data visualizations---between the three of them and their variations, you can usually get a pretty good feel for the overall shape of your data, before you drill down and do analysis on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a couple more fancy things.  First, you can squeeze an extra color dimension in boxplots too, and that can help you see things like whether, for example, there's variation in salary by gender across different ranks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interpretation of that table should be pretty obvious  In lots of ways, this looks worse for the gender equity in this notional department: it looks like higher-ranking women are getting distinctively less well paid than men, with the exeption of that one super-high-paid woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fancy plot is a violin plot, which is like a boxplot, except that it uses one of those kernel estimators to make it possible to visualize the rough number of data points in a given point on the y-axis scale, and doesn't do the interquartile range and outliers thing.  Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, these look quite different from the boxplots, although they capture the same information.  Note that I used an option to draw lines in the middle of each plot for each datapoint (that was the &lt;code&gt;inner="stick"&lt;/code&gt; bit).  There are lots of different options with violin plots, and the intuitions they give you can be a bit sensitive to how you choose those options, so I don't recommend them as a first choice.  For example, this plot might make you think different things about the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I did there was scale the sizes of the violins to the number of points in them.  This is probably a bit more honest than the previous one, in terms of seeing where things actually lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, we're going to learn how to open files and work with data from the disk. We'll start with the mechanical process of opening text files, and then move on to learn a little bit more about different kinds of data you'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the basic method of opening and reading text files. Suppose I have a file called hello.txt in my working directory.  (Your working directory is the directory you run Python from on your hard drive.  For those of you using Azure Notebooks, this should be your library, but talk to me if you see a file there and can't read it from Python.)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, we're going to learn how to open files and work with data from the disk. We'll start with the mechanical process of opening text files, and then move on to learn a little bit more about different kinds of data you'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the basic method of opening and reading text files. Suppose I have a file called hello.txt in my working directory.  (Your working directory is the directory you run Python from on your hard drive.  For those of you using Azure Notebooks, this should be your library, but talk to me if you see a file there and can't read it from Python.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_awesome_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_awesome_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;hello, I am a text file
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's break down that code.  The first line starting with &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; is known as a &lt;em&gt;context manager&lt;/em&gt;.  Any time you see &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; in Python, what you should think is "this is going to change what's going on in my computer for the duration of this block."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you can pretty much read exactly what's going to happen like it's English rather than Python. For the duration of the indented block below that first line, all the code in there is going to be executed &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; the file &lt;code&gt;hello.text&lt;/code&gt; being &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; and hence available for reading. Inside that block, the name &lt;code&gt;my_awesome_file&lt;/code&gt; is going to be assigned to the open file (that's what the &lt;code&gt;as&lt;/code&gt; statement does).  The second parameter to the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function, the &lt;code&gt;'r'&lt;/code&gt;, just indicates that you're going to open it for reading---instead of, for example, opening it for writing, in which case the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; would change to a &lt;code&gt;w&lt;/code&gt;.  You can also open a file to append with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;---to add more data to the bottom of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that's assigned to &lt;code&gt;my_open_file&lt;/code&gt; is called a &lt;em&gt;file handle&lt;/em&gt;, it's just a normal Python object that gives you access to the data inside. In this case, that object has a method, &lt;code&gt;read()&lt;/code&gt;, that gives you the contents of the file as a string. Which we then printed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at writing and appending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;still_my_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;still_my_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I contain something different now!!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_awesome_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_awesome_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;I contain something different now!!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see that when we open a file for writing, we overwrite what was already there.  What if you don't want to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hi again!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;my_file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Hi human user!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we want to put more lines in the file, and then read the file line by line into a list.  We could do that, in the first case, by adding the special character &lt;code&gt;'\n'&lt;/code&gt;, and in the second case, by using the &lt;code&gt;readlines()&lt;/code&gt; method of the file object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;I contain something different now!!Hi again!Hi human user!\n&amp;#39;, &amp;#34;Here&amp;#39;s a newline.  But:\n&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Newlines don&amp;#39;t have to be at the start of a string.&amp;#34;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as Python is concerned, there are two kinds of files that you might want to open: text files and binary files. If you want to open a binary file, you pass &lt;code&gt;'rb'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'wb'&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt; as the second parameter, depending on whether you want to read or write the binary file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much all the files you'll be working with in this course will be text files: they'll be txt files, csv files (spreadsheet-like data stored in a plain text format), json files (key-value and list-like data stored in a plain text format), or the like. Here are some common binary file formats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zip files (compressed file archives)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Word docx files  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PDF files  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;images of all kinds (with the exception of SVG files, which are fancy vector images that are stored as text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In almost every case, it'll make more sense to use a function from a library to open a binary file, rather than manipulate it directly. There are libraries to handle PDFs, Word files, and the like. So I won't belabor it here, but the difference between reading as text and reading as binary is one you need in your head for a moment (I'm about to break it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reading CSV files, the best choice is to use the &lt;em&gt;Pandas&lt;/em&gt; library, which should be installed for you already, rather than the built-in Python CSV library. The latter is a bit obscurely organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[6]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mydata&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;rol-scores.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll spend some time in Pandas later on, but I wanted you to get a basic look at it now. We just opened a CSV file containing data from my rule of law book (shameless plug), &lt;a href="http://rulelaw.net"&gt;The Rule of Law in the Real World&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so remember how I said that there's a difference between text and binary files?  That's... not entirely honest. Computers ultimately store everything in binary, just as a bunch of ones and zeroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't have to work with the ones and zeroes directly. But you might have to worry about the layer of abstraction one level up. The way that Python mostly sees all kinds of files is as a series of &lt;em&gt;bytes&lt;/em&gt;---eight-bit binary numbers. This includes text files!  So, if we want, we can open up a text file as bytes.  (Let's reset our text file to its original state first, so it's nice and short.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[8]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;w&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello, I am a text file&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to open it as binary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;binary_text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;b&amp;#39;hello, I am a text file&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all that exciting, right? The b in front of the string just means that it's held in memory as bytes---but Python still knows it's a string and will happily print it out for you just like a text file.  If you really want to see an approximation of what things look like under the hood ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[10]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on there?  Well, when you asked for it to be binary, Python read the string as bytes, and the internal representation is a series of numbers. Those numbers correspond to letters.  To get a string back out of it, you have to &lt;em&gt;decode&lt;/em&gt; it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[11]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decoded&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;decoded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this stuff all matter?  Well, basically, it matters because languages other than English exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, if strings are just sequences of numbers, there needs to be a rule on how to translate numbers to things humans can read and back.  Humans can't read "104 101 108 108 111" as "hello" very easily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the early days of computing, this was easy but lazy. The only people that the people who made computers cared about, at least in the U.S., were English speakers. And so the main rule for how to translate numbers to letters---known as an "encoding"---was called "ASCII."  It contained the entire alphabet that we're familiar with in the U.S., plus some punctuation, and represented it all as a series of numbers from 0 to 127.  &lt;a href="http://www.asciitable.com/"&gt;Here's a table of ASCII numbers to letters&lt;/a&gt;.  You can still see that today.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[12]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;chr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;65&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[12]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read that as "give me the character at number 65."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, we don't use ASCII, and Python's internal representation of characters isn't ASCII.  To prove that, let's look at some big numbers for characters!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[13]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;chr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;128516&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[13]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;😄&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right.  It's an emoji.  We have emojis now.  But, more importantly, we have letters from other languages. Like Japanese:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[14]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;chr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12365&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[14]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;き&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new text encoding that most things are in these days is called &lt;em&gt;UTF-8&lt;/em&gt;.  It's much, much, much bigger than ASCII, which is what allows us to have Japanese and emojis and more besides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch, and why this is sometimes a problem, is that in addition to ASCII and UTF-8, there are lots of other character encodings floating around out there.  For example, there's an encoding called Latin-1 that a bunch of Microsoft products have been known to use. Sometimes, you'll see data (like maybe saved as a CSV from some version of Excel) in that character encoding, and then everything will look funny.  If you've ever opened a file with a bunch of question marks and weird black diamonds in place of characters you've expected to see (known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake"&gt;mojibake&lt;/a&gt;), that's because the program you used to open it thought it was a different character encoding than the program used to save it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, this shouldn't be a problem for you in this class, as long as you follow the following basic rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a version of Python numbered 3 or greater.  Python 2.x had a lot of screwed up stuff with string encodings that Python 3 fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always open and save anything in UTF-8.  Don't touch any other encoding, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get unlucky enough to find something in another encoding, try Latin-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, ideally your system default coding is UTF-8 (UTF-16 will also do).  You can check that with the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[15]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getdefaultencoding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[15]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, some terminology.  Decoding means converting from binary to a string. Encoding means converting from a string to a binary with a particular encoding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you run into problems with this, usually involving Python complaining that a codec can't decode something, come talk to me and we'll dig into it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[&amp;nbsp;]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

Here's what they mean: suppose you could see all of the instances of the thing you're trying to study. What kind of pattern would their values have? That's the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you expect that most of the values of the thing you care about will be clustered around some average value. IQ is a good example: most IQs in the population are around 100, and then as values get further away from 100 in either direction, the fraction of the total number of instances that takes that range of values gets smaller. There are lots of folks with an IQ between 85 and 115, fewer between 70 and 85 on one side, and 115 and 130, many fewer between 55 and 70 or 130 and 145, and a (proportionally) truly tiny number between 40-55 or 145-160.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;h2 id="What's-a-Distribution,-Anyway?"&gt;What's a Distribution, Anyway?&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#What's-a-Distribution,-Anyway?"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistics people often talk about distributions, like a normal distribution. Here's what they mean: suppose you could see all of the instances of the thing you're trying to study. What kind of pattern would their values have? That's the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you expect that most of the values of the thing you care about will be clustered around some average value. IQ is a good example: most IQs in the population are around 100, and then as values get further away from 100 in either direction, the fraction of the total number of instances that takes that range of values gets smaller. There are lots of folks with an IQ between 85 and 115, fewer between 70 and 85 on one side, and 115 and 130, many fewer between 55 and 70 or 130 and 145, and a (proportionally) truly tiny number between 40-55 or 145-160.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, what I just described is a normal distribution---IQs follow it. For reasons to be explained later, lots of distributions follow it. But before we dig into the normal, let's say a bit more about distributions in the abstract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a good bit of underlying mathematics to describe distributions, but it requires calculus, and won't be necessary for the introductory level of this course. That being said, you'll probably see some of this terminology elsewhere, so I'll give you a quick vocabulary list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: A distribution where the thing you care about can take any value in its range. The normal distribution is an example of a continuous distribution. Think about the distribution of incomes (which, incidentally, are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; typically normally distributed), where&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discrete distribution&lt;/strong&gt;: A distribution where the thing you care about can take a discrete number of values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probability Density Function (PDF)&lt;/strong&gt;: The function that describes the curve of a continuous distribution. If you've seen the famously scary normal distribution equation, with, like, e, and a square root, and all kinds of other craziness floating around, that's a PDF. Don't worry about it, though.  We won't be using this directly in class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probability Mass Function (PMF)&lt;/strong&gt;: Like a PDF, but for a discrete distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulative Density Function&lt;/strong&gt;: A much more readily understandable concept, basically, you plug in a value to a CDF and get the probability of seeing a value less than or equal to that. Hence the cumulative part. For those who remember calculus, the CDF is just the integral of the PDF. Again, we won't be working with this directly. There's also a CDF of discrete variables, which works the same except it's a sum rather than an integral, and sometimes people write "cumulative distribution function" instead of density (sometimes).  (For that matter, sometimes they write "distribution" for the continuous one too. Stats people. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Normal-distributions"&gt;Normal distributions&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Normal-distributions"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The normal distribution is the famous bell-shaped curve, sometimes also called a "Gaussian" distribution. Let's plot one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to know is that a normal distribution is defined by two &lt;em&gt;parameters&lt;/em&gt;---the mean of the distribution, traditionally represented by the greek letter mu ($\mu$) and the &lt;em&gt;standard deviation&lt;/em&gt; (which is a measure of how spread out it is, we'll talk more about this later), traditionally represented by the greek letter sigma ($\sigma$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sensible way to plot a normal distribution would be to just draw a bunch of data randomly from that distribution and plot a histogram. As it turns out, basically every stats library has one built in, so let's use the scipy library to grab a lot of points. Say, a hundred thousand, because, what the heck, computers can count fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get a bunch of random values from a distribution by calling &lt;code&gt;scipy.stats.norm.rvs(mu, sigma, num_values)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, let's use the &lt;em&gt;standard normal&lt;/em&gt;, namely, a normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is something you'll be seeing a lot of later on, a lot of stuff in stats is based on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that the simulated data follows the familiar bell-shaped curve.  (Incidentally, the &lt;code&gt;np.random.seed()&lt;/code&gt; function just ensures that the random numbers will be generated the same way on repeated runs. Talk to me in class if you want to know more detail about what's going on there. But this is a good thing to set to make sure you can reproduce things that rely on computer-generated randomness... which is really pseudo-randomness but is good enough.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, as you might expect for random drawa from a distribution, you can be quite confident that a big number like 100,000 will fit the classic curve, but the nature of randomness is that it might not happen with smaller numbers. For example, suppose we just took fifty draws:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a fact about the normal distribution that you should just memorize. 95% of the data will be within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean on either side. Equivalently, this means that with the standard normal (mean of 0, standard deviation of 1), only about 2.5% of the data will be above 1.96, and 2.5% of the data will be below -1.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turns out to be the basis for a bunch of classical statistics, because of some fabulous properties about how data works in the wild that we'll look at later. For now, just memorize that fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a visualization to help you remember this. The shaded areas are the points above 1.96 and below -1.96.  Don't worry about this code right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Translating that in terms of our histogram---when we drew 100,000 random numbers from the normal distribution, we would expect that roughly 95,000 of them were within -1.96 and 1.96.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can prove that to you. Numpy, the Python numerics library, allows us to filter an array (a specialized list) of numbers by a condition, so we can see how many of the random numbers we got fell within that range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, supposedly the mean of male adult heights in the U.S. is about 69 inches, and the standard deviation is about 3 inches.  So 68% of men will be between 66 and 72 inches, and then just over 95% of men will be between 63 and 75 inches ("just over" because recall that 95% is 1.96 standard deviations from the mean, not 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll see lots more of the normal distribution. But for now let's look at another important distribution or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists usually say that income follows a log-normal distribution. Let's look at the shape of that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, economists often use the log of income rather than income in their models, partly to take advantage of some of the properties of normal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, think for a minute about the shape of that lognormal curve.  It makes sense, right?  There are lots more poor people than rich people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about another distribution. If you took AP stats or an introductory stats class in college, you probably heard of the chi-squared test. Well, there's a distribution underneath it. Here's what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason scientists like the normal distribution so much is because of a two little ideas called &lt;strong&gt;the law of large numbers&lt;/strong&gt; (LLN) and the &lt;strong&gt;central limit theorem&lt;/strong&gt; (CLT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to walk you through proofs of these; instead, we'll just look at some graphs and talk about some intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core idea of the LLN and CLT working together is this: imagine there is a quantity of interest out there in the world, and it is distributed according to any arbitrary distribution, and you want to know the mean. For example, suppose you are interested in knowing the average income in the United States. We known, empirically, that incomes tend to be distributed according to a lognormal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sensible way we might choose to figure out the mean income in the United States is by drawing a random sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, suppose we have a pretty good list of every person in the country and their phone numbers. We might randomly pick, say, a thousand of them to call.  If we were doing this course in a heavily math-ey approach, we might here say "the expected value of the sampling mean is equal to the population mean," and we might talk about a proof of that, and use a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Java/Html/SampleDist.htm"&gt;complicated vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;. Here, I'm just going to draw out some intuition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold in your head a picture of the log-normal distribution. Like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine you threw darts at the graph, without aiming at a particular part of the graph. On the whole, you'd expect that when the darts hit inside the figure, they'd more or less spread out proportional to the area of the graph, that is, areas of the graph that are bigger would have more dots in them.  Moreover, you'd expect that this proportionality property would be more consistent the more darts you throw.  If you just toss one dart in, it could land anywhere.  If you toss a million darts in, the shape of the area they occupy within the graph is likely to be essentially the same as the shape of the graph itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, where there's more space under the graph, there's also more dots. And this should allow you to see intuitively how we ought to expect the average x value of the random observations of a variable with that distribution, or, indeed, any distribution, to typically be close to the average x value of the entite universe of possible observations (the population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, in a nutshell, is the LLN, and is why random sampling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose we did that a bunch of times. That is, we had our list of people and their phone numbers, and we picked a thousand of them, and called them, and asked them about their income.  Then we picked a thousand people again, and ask them about their income.  And again.  And again.  And again.  In stats-ese, we sampled them repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties of those samples &lt;em&gt;also has a distribution&lt;/em&gt;. This is called a &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/sampling-distributions-library"&gt;sampling distribution&lt;/a&gt; In particular, the means of those samples also have a distribution.  But before I tell you what that distribution is, let's simulate it with some code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll generate a lot of random lognormal data (again, representing income), and then we'll sample from it repeatedly, and for each of our samples, we'll write down the mean, and we'll see how those means are distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right.  It looks super normal, and it's centered on the population mean.  This is the central limit theorem in action: when we take random samples from a population, &lt;em&gt;even if the distribution itself isn't normal&lt;/em&gt;, the distribution &lt;em&gt;of the sample means&lt;/em&gt; will be normally distributed with a mean approximately equal to the population mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why we can estimate the mean of some property of a population just by sampling it---why, for example, the media can get a pretty good guess about who will win an election by asking a bunch of people at random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the central limit theorem works better for larger sample sizes, and for larger numbers of samples.  So if we did just a handful of tiny little samples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at last we know if we get big samples we're more likely to get the mean right.  (This is an intuitive way of saying that the variance of sample means falls with sample size... about which more down the line.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, even with tiny samples, the expected value of the mean still is the population mean, so if we imagined doing a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of tiny samples, they would still be more or less normally distributed around the true mean... it's just that we couldn't have a lot of confidence in any individual sample.&lt;/p&gt;

We'll delve into this more down the line, but here's the basic idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you think that some fact is true about the world---for example, you have a theory saying that the average income of Americans should be about the same as a known quantity $\mu$ (let's say you know the average income in Iowa, it's $\mu$, and you think America as a whole looks like Iowa, income-wise).  Or you have a theory saying they should be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now supose you draw a large sample of Americans' incomes and take the mean of that sample. You know that this is, effectly, a single observation of a variable (the distribution of sampling means) which is normally distributed---that's what we just learned from the central limit theorem. And (it will turn out... we'll get there) you can estimate the standard deviation of that normal distribution too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose your mean of the sample of American incomes is wildly different from the mean of Iowan incomes---say it's three standard deviations away. That would be pretty unlikely if you were &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; drawing from a population with the mean of Iowan's incomes. Not impossible, just... unlikely. We know that a very small percentage of draws from a normal distribution with a given mean $\mu$ are going to be three whole standard deviations away from $\mu$. Rather than think "wow, I guess we got a freakish sample from something with mean $\mu$" you might be motivated to instead think "hmm, maybe the mean of American incomes isn't $\mu$ -- maybe Americans and Iowans aren't the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That little intuition is the basis for the enterprise of hypothesis testing, p-values, significance levels, all the asterisks you see in scientific papers, and so forth. We will explore it further in subsequent lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lesson is all about what can go wrong in linear regression.  Here's an outline of the ways things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data isn't linear&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extreme outliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heteroskadiscity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multicolinnearity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditioning on a collider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;counfounder bias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-normal residuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a problem known as "autocorrelation" which mainly appears in time series data (i.e., when one tries to run a regression on something that changes over time, like stock market prices). Time series analysis is a fairly advanced topic that is beyond the scope of this course, but you should have alarm bells ringing if anyone tries to do ordinary linear regression on data that spans time like that.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;p&gt;This lesson is all about what can go wrong in linear regression.  Here's an outline of the ways things can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data isn't linear&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extreme outliers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;heteroskadiscity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;multicolinnearity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conditioning on a collider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;counfounder bias&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-normal residuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also a problem known as "autocorrelation" which mainly appears in time series data (i.e., when one tries to run a regression on something that changes over time, like stock market prices). Time series analysis is a fairly advanced topic that is beyond the scope of this course, but you should have alarm bells ringing if anyone tries to do ordinary linear regression on data that spans time like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, this material is taught in terms of "assumptions of regression."  We say that linear regression assumes certain things about your data/the world that your data represent.  This is kind of indirect language, however. When stats people talk about "assumptions" what they really mean are "things that have to be true or the regression gets the wrong answer."  So we'll just directly talk about the wrong answer and how it can be detected or avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about this is as a core part (along with the discussion of p values and power from last week) of your developing a BS detector for statistical claims, offered by scientific studies, expert witnesses, or otherwise.  One way of spewing statistical BS is to report the results of a regression which fails these "assumptions" --- which doesn't actually give you real information.  So in order to keep from being taken in by the BS, you need to know how regressions can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will also cover some of the major diagnostic methods for identifying these problems, however, this will be far from comprehensive. Statsmodels has &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/diagnostic.html"&gt;a list of the various diagnostics that are built in&lt;/a&gt;; it's never wrong to google some of those to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Linear-Regression:-read-the-first-word-again."&gt;Linear Regression: read the first word again.&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Linear-Regression:-read-the-first-word-again."&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a lot of ways, the fundamental technical flaw of bad linear regressions is to use it to attempt to represent nonlinear relationships. Remember that what a linear regression does is draws a line (in two dimensions, a plane, or a &lt;em&gt;hyperplane&lt;/em&gt; (wooooo) or such in more dimensions) that best allows us to predict the dependent variable from the independent variables.  But what if the relationship isn't linear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a very famous set of data visualizations, called &lt;em&gt;Anscombe's quartet&lt;/em&gt;, that illustrates this.  It's so important that they actually built it into seaborn, so we can just directly run an example plot from their own documentation and take a look:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anscombe's quartet is really deep (check out &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet"&gt;the wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; for details).  What you're looking at is four distinct datasets that have identical means and variances in both x and y, identical correlation coefficients between x and y, and identical linear regression coefficients with identical r-squareds. (!!!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to keep coming back to this, but for now I just want you to focus on the top row, and compare the top left with the top right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top left is a great linear regression dataset.  The relationship looks very linear, in the sense that when x increases, y increases, and it looks like by about the same amount, give or take, each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top right is a terrible linear regression dataset.  You can visibly see that the line that OLS is trying to fit here doesn't even remotely match the shape of the data.  What this means is that you'll get regression coefficients out of this, but they won't mean very much at all, because there isn't actually relationship between x and y about which we can say "when x changes by some amount, y changes by some other amount"; or, at least, if there is such a range it doesn't exist over the entire range of x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, data transformations can be used to make nonlinear data fit a linear form. The log transformation we looked at a few weeks ago, for example, is pretty good at suppressing some kinds of nonlinearity, though at the cost of making our regression coefficients a bit harder to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we might try a polynomial transformation, that is, instead of fitting the regression on x, maybe fit it on x squared, or x cubed.  That can allow the regression line to stop being, well, a line, and turn into a curve, which can more closely fit the data.  Indeed, this will turn out to be a pretty good match for this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that code, the &lt;code&gt;order=2&lt;/code&gt; parameter told seaborn to, behind the scenes, fit a polynomial regression with order 2 (that is, with a squared independent variable---order 3 would be a cubed independent variable) to the data.  So this would more accurately reflect our data, but the price (as with all such transformations) would, yet again, be that the coefficients would be harder to interpret. (When x-squared increases by A, y increases by B... huh?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also another price to using higher-order regressions.  Very high-order polynomials are likely to "overfit."  What's overfitting?  Look at the first dataset in anscombe's quartet again.  What would happen if instead of drawing a straight diagonal line, you drew a line connecting every single point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(discussion of overfitting and advantage of parameters in terms of importing assumptions about general form of data rather than just reflecting the data you have, generalization.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the high-order polynomials are basically doing here is effectively fitting a line to that runs through more of the points.  But every dataset has error in it, whether it's measurement error or error (variance, really) rooted in the fact that you have a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By fitting a high degree polynomial, effectively you force the regression to take account of more of the variation between data points.  This is good when that variation is real variation, i.e., reflects the underlying process that generates the data (the thing the scientist is trying to study).  It's bad when the variation is just noise, because noise in your dataset doesn't tell you anything about the real underlying truth in the population.  So it's a bad idea to fit the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this suggests is that a polynomial regression would be a good idea for #2, because it really looks like there's a kind of polynomial form to the data (a curve).  But it would be a bad idea for #1, because a straight line is probably an adequate model for the data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Extreme-Outliers"&gt;Extreme Outliers&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Extreme-Outliers"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go back to Anscombe's quartet at the top of this lesson.  Look at the lower two rows.  Both are examples of how extreme outliers can distort regression results. The problem is that they'll have large squared errors, and so they'll exercise disproportionate influence on the coefficients you ultimately get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outliers are kind of similar to nonlinearity, in the sense that often they will be points radically off from a line that does a good job of fitting the other data. But they need not always represent a nonlinearity---there might be an outlier that lies on the same line as the rest of the data, but just has more extreme values on all dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outliers are sometimes also called "influential points."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of strategies to deal with outliers. Sometimes, there's good theoretical reason to think they're just measurement error and should be removed. (Remember the people in the Shonubi dataset who were supposedly caught carrying 2000 grams of heroin in a single trip?  Uh, no. Someone did a typo that added an extra digit.)  Generally, however, that's a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this class, we won't address the alternative strategies (techniques like robust regression) used to accommodate outliers. Detecting them is worthwhile though, and sometimes a bit difficult in multivariate context. (In single-variable regression you can just use a scatterplot.)  Statsmodels provides an &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.graphics.regressionplots.influence_plot.html"&gt;influence plot&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to try to pick out individual points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

(Don't ever ask me to try to spell that.)  The basic idea here is different residuals along different parts of the range of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a classic way to see this, which comes from a scatterplot of the residuals vs fitted values.  You'll often see a kind of fan shape in these plots, where as fitted values grow (or shrink) the residuals increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example.  We'll pull down my book dataset again just for an easy dataset with more variables in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annoyingly, there isn't a library method to do a fitted vs residual plot, but we can do it ourselves very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's start by looking at a plot that lacks heteroskedasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so this was a contrived example, but it works: look how the residuals get more dispersed as we get to higher fitted values.  That's the classic fan shape, and it reveals bad heteroskedasticity.  (As well it ought to, since I imposed it on the data by force.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence of heteroskedasticity is that our p values will be too low---essentially, OLS will be underestimating the amount of variance in the data, and thus concluding that coefficients are more signifiant than they really are.  Practically speaking, what that means is that finding heteroskedasticity is a great way to bust up a supposed significant result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, a residual vs fitted plot is also a great way to detect nonlinear relationships. For example!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Multicollinearity"&gt;Multicollinearity&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Multicollinearity"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another fancy name for a simple problem: when some of the independent (right-side) variables in a regression model are highly correlated with one another. This is a problem, essentially, because it means that it's meaningless to talk about the independent effect of them on your regression. Put differently, if one variable is highly correlated with another so that they're basically measuring the same thing, then when you include them both in your model, they're effectively controlling one another away, leading to nonsensical results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to make this mistake is just to put a variable and some linear transformation of that variable into the model---for example, &lt;code&gt;y ~ xa + xb + xc&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;xc = 3 * xa&lt;/code&gt; --- in effect, you're saying that the coefficient on x should be how the value of y changes when &lt;code&gt;xa&lt;/code&gt; changes, holding &lt;code&gt;3 * xa&lt;/code&gt; constant, which is obviously nonsensical. But it's possible to fall into multicollinearity problems in less obvious ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note how the coefficient on the elec_pros variable is different.  Also notice the "Cond. No." at the bottom of the summary results. This is the "condition number," a common indicator of multicollinearity; in the previous regression it was HUGE (something with 16 zeroes after it). Now it's 45.  Actually, a standard rule of thumb that people use is that any condition number over 30 gives you reason to worry about multicollinearty, so we might not even be out of the weeds here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually shouldn't be surprising, given the nature of the underlying variables--- "electoral process" and "political pluralism" in this dataset are both indicators of a country's underlying democratic freedoms, so we'd expect them to be fairly highly correlated. Indeed, there are multicollinearity problems in most regressions we might try for the rule of law dataset, because the underlying variables just happen to be closely related to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the statsmodels condition number functionality appears to be a little bit noisy---it reports high condition numbers sometimes even in single-variable regression, so I wouldn't trust it too much.  So for present purposes we'll put this in the "not going to deal with it further; google it and use R if it comes up in real life" box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there can be worries about multicollinearity when including interaction terms in a model. &lt;em&gt;Interaction terms&lt;/em&gt; are multiplying variables together, for example, &lt;code&gt;y ~ xa + xb + xc + xa * xb&lt;/code&gt;.  This is a common technique to capture situations where the theory suggests that the impact of one independent variable on the outcome will depend on the value of another variable. For example, suppose you think that women are discriminated against &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; when they have more education, because men are threatened by smart women---such that education might be a disadvantage for women but an advantage for men. One way to capture this would be in an interaction term between years of education and a binary (indicator) variable for gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of multicollinearity with interaction terms, some people advise either leaving off the un-interacted variables (i.e., leave off the variables for gender and for education, leaving just the interaction), others suggest mean-centering the variables (subtracting the mean of the variable from each value of it). These are also sometimes suggested as a way to handle multicollinearity risks from quadratic terms (like squaring an independent variable). But the mean-centering thing is debatable, and dropping other terms might not capture the theory underlying the model. Many stats folks just recommend &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/methodology/2012/11/28/unhealthy/"&gt;gathering more data covering more extreme values of the underlying variables&lt;/a&gt;, so that the interaction/quadratic terms will vary more widely from their underlying components, hopefully meaning less multicollinearity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as long as you don't have &lt;em&gt;extreme&lt;/em&gt; multicollinearity (i.e., measuring the same thing multiple ways), having somewhat correlated variables won't necessarily make a regression do anything truly terrible... the mostly common problem is that it will inflate standard errors, and hence make it much harder to detect statistically significant effects---because, as noted, effectively you'll have a variable controlling itself away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="Conditioning-on-a-Collider"&gt;Conditioning on a Collider&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Conditioning-on-a-Collider"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sort of vaguely related idea to multicollinearity (in the sense that we're worried about controlling away the effects we're trying to measure) is conditioning on a collider (also known as "collider bias").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's a &lt;em&gt;collider&lt;/em&gt;?  It's something that is influenced (in a causal sense) both by the dependent variable and by an independent variable. For example, suppose you're doing a study of whether race influences the number of times a person reports having ever been stoped by the police. Degree of reported trust in the police would probably be a collider there, because both being a member of a minoritized race and being stopped by the cops would be likely to increase the chance of distrusting the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's &lt;em&gt;conditioning&lt;/em&gt;?  It's, loosely speaking (being a bit hand-wavey in order to avoid reintroducing technical probability stuff), making your estimation depend on it or changing your estimation procedure because of it. This includes selecting cases depending (intentionally or unintentionally) on their value with respect to the collider (this is a common issue in experimental studies that use convenience samples, like college students forced to take psych studies in a class, where being included in the sample population might be a collider), and also includes putting the collider on the right side of your regression model.  In the example above, either putting trust in your regression or studying a sample where inclusion depends on whether they say they distrust the cops would be conditioning on a collider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related problem is conditioning on a post-treatment variable in an experimental context, that is, conditioning on a variable that might be influenced by the treatment, for example, by dropping subjects who don't comply with the instructions in the experiment. Also a bad idea (known as "post-treatment bias").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these are bad and can totally mess over results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Counfounder-Bias"&gt;Counfounder Bias&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Counfounder-Bias"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, omitted variable bias is a general term for variables that you ought to include because not doing so breaks the results of your regression---because they also might cause your dependent variable, and if they're associated with the independent variable in the wrong kinds of ways, leaving them off can distort the results of our regression.  Remember our Simpson's Paradox example from a couple of weeks ago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward kind of omitted variable bias is confounder bias.  A &lt;em&gt;confounder&lt;/em&gt; is a variable that exercises a causal influence on both the dependent variable and an independent variable.  For example, suppose you're studying whether taking extended periods of time off work affects satisfaction with management using a regression.  It's fairly likely that gender affects both of those things---the first because of pregnancy, and the second because of sexual harassment and other kinds of workplace misconduct directed against women. So you should include it on the right side of your regression.&lt;/p&gt;

A quick and easy way to check for this is to do what's known as a &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.graphics.gofplots.qqplot.html"&gt;q-q plot&lt;/a&gt; or (slightly different but serves the same purpose, a probability plot can serve), plotting the residuals of your model against a normal.

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to add several caveats to this discussion of the statsmodels results output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveat 1&lt;/strong&gt;.  Statsmodels has, frankly, terrible documentation.  And a number of the tests in the third row could be applied to a number of different things (i.e., to the distribution of the residuals from our model, as opposed to, say, the dependent variable or something), and the document doesn't specifically say what statsmodels applies them to to generate the summary output.  I'm going to &lt;em&gt;assume&lt;/em&gt; that they are being applied to the things they're supposed to be applied to, because the people who wrote statsmodels aren't stupid. This is almost certainly a safe assumption, but I really don't like making any assumptions, so, in a critical context, I'd probably want to look up the statsmodels functions for a particular test and apply them directly to the residuals myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, though, for regressions I'd probably just use a different language---R has much more fleshed-out documentation as well as the advantage of being used by a truly large number of stats people, so that the toolkit for basic models like regression has been combed over by countless experts.  If I were teaching a full-scale regression analysis class (as opposed to just touching on it in the context of lots of other things where a real general-purpose programming language is more useful than a specialized stats language) I'd teach it in R. And if you find yourself doing regressions seriously, go learn R and do them in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveat 2&lt;/strong&gt;. No single diagnostic number or even collection of diagnostic numbers will tell you whether a regression is usefully specified or not.  These are cues to further investigate, and to adjust (like a good Bayesian) your ultimate belief in the propositions that the model is supposed to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caveat 3&lt;/strong&gt;. We're not digging into this in a lot of detail here. And we probably won't have time to discuss this stuff in class. For practical lawyering purposes, the main point of seeing this kind of material is just to have an extra couple of questions to ask, or possibly triggers of things to worry about, for example, when you see an expert report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those caveats in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;omnibus test&lt;/em&gt; is a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal. Assuming statsmodels is sensible here, this hypothesis test is being applied to the residuals, so the important thing is the &lt;code&gt;prob(omnibus)&lt;/code&gt; entry, and a low p-value suggests that we should probably worry about having non-normal residuals. The &lt;em&gt;Jarque-Bera test&lt;/em&gt; is another test for normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Durbin-Watson statistic&lt;/em&gt; is a measure of autocorrelation. As I said, this is mostly important in time series data, which comes up most commonly in the context of financial modeling---I understand from the folks who do this work that the range of this statistic is 0-4, and that the closer to 2, the less likely that there's a worry about autocorrelation; generally 1.5-2.5 is ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skew and Kurtosis&lt;/em&gt; are measures of how far off a distribution is from normal---skew is about whether it's not symmetrical (like more data on the left or right), kurtosis is about how spiky it is. A normal distribution should have skew around zero; and a standard normal will have kurtosis of 3. &lt;a href="https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35b.htm"&gt;Here's a good read&lt;/a&gt; from NIST on skew and kurtosis. You'll hear different things about acceptable ranges of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've already talked about the condition number---and about how the example data is just full of All the Multicollinearity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't the only regression diagnostic tests statsmodels offers---check out &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/diagnostic.html"&gt;their documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more. But this will do as a summary for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a web browser like Chrome to go to a URL ("uniform resource locator," or web address) like https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com, what you're actually doing is sending a request using the HTTPS protocol (which is the same at the HTTP protocol, but with some more encryption on top). HTTP stands for "hypertext transfer protocol," and it was originally designed for the web.  There are other protocols---you may have seen FTP, for example, which stands for "file transfer protocol," and "SMTP" which stands for "simple mail transfer protocol," but HTTP/S is by far the most important. It turns out that people make information other than web pages available through that protocol, which you can request the same way you request a web page. And you don't need a web browser to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HTTP requests are made up of "verbs," which are just capitalized (by convention) words that describe what you want to do. Servers out on the internet will ask you to use one verb or another in order to access their resources. The two most important verbs are GET and POST. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GET requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GET request is the basic request of the web. When you send a GET request to a URL, you're asking for the resources associated with that location. (Sometimes, internet people use the word "endpoint" to mean a specific location on a server.).  Ordinary web access through a browser is made up of GET requests: when you type  "https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com" into your browser, you make a GET request to the route endpoint of that website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can send data to a server via a GET request. When you do, the data is actually built into the URL itself.  If you've ever seen a URL like https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/catinfo?cat=Leonidas&amp;amp;info=cutenessquotient then you've seen data being sent to the server that way. The stuff after the question mark is known as a "query string," and it is a collection of key-value pairs much like a Python dictionary. The URL above translates to "hey server at sociologicalgobbledygook.com, I'd like to tell your 'catinfo' endpoint that the cat is 'Leonidas' and the info is 'cutenessquotient'." Typically, the server will use that data to find some information and generate a response to send back. For example, the catinfo endpoint might be programmed to connect to a database containing information about cats, so that the server will look up Leonidas in that database and find his cuteness quotient (it's &lt;em&gt;INFINITY&lt;/em&gt; in case you were curious), and then send that information back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, in most cases you won't want to write your own query strings to send data via GET requests. There are complicated rules for how query strings are composed (because there are a bunch of things that aren't allowed in them, like spaces). Instead, you'll use code written by someone else to translate a more useful format into a query string before sending them along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;POST requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST requests are designed for sending more substantial data to a server. For example, suppose you run a service that allows people to upload files over the web: you'd tell them to submit those files via a POST request. You can also send longer text data through a POST request, and lots of other things besides. Typically, when you see a form on a web page (like a registration form, or a survey), the information that you fill in there gets sent to the server in a POST request. POST requests come in a variety of formats, but the most common and important is "multipart/form-data"---when in doubt, it's safe to assume that this is what you're sending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll explain how to send a POST request below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Headers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the content, or "body," of a request, HTTP requests also have headers. You can think of this like the headers of a document, they tend to contain metadata, or information about the information inside, such as the size of the data being sent. For the most part, you don't need to worry about headers, but there are a couple of important pieces of information that they tend to contain.  First, they often contain authentication information: many servers will require you to send a username and password, or a "token" (a special string issued by the server that identifies you, sort of like the server's equivalent of a social security number) in a particular format in the headers in order to be allowed to get access to the data they have. Second, they often contain a description of the type of content being sent. For example, if you send text, it might contain information about the character encoding (we'll learn about that in a subsequent lesson) that the text is in. If you send a file, it might contain information about the format the file is in.  More about formats and encodings below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Responses&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so you've sent a GET or a POST request to a server somewhere. The thing you get back is called a response. It has several parts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First is a response code: a 3-digit number saying, in broad terms, what the server thinks of your response. Have you ever navigated to a web page that doesn't exist and gotten a 404 error?  404 is a response code that means exactly what you think it means: that the server can't find the endpoint you asked for (or the webpage you asked for). Generally, any response code in the 400s is the server's way of telling you that you screwed up---another common one is 403, which means "forbidden"---typically returned by a server when you ask for something that requires authentication, but you haven't given it the password or whatever other authentication resource it wants in a form that it recognizes. 401 means roughly the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the response code you want to get is 200, which means "ok." Anything in the 200 range is going to be a desired response code.  If you get anything in the 500 range, it usually signifies a programming error on the server side (i.e., not your fault). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response will also contain information about the format of the content inside, though its Content-Type header.  A response often has &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers"&gt;other headers too&lt;/a&gt;, but Content-Type tends to be the most important (along with Content-Encoding), as they will tell you what kind of content you're getting back, which is information that tends to be necessary in order to do anything with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Requests library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the most popular way to work with HTTP requests in Python is through a library called &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it very easy to send requests and deal with responses. It's a third party library (not distributed with Python itself), but it comes pre-installed for you on Azure Notebooks, and also will already be installed if you've followed the personal machine installation instructions for this course and installed the Anaconda distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get access to the Requests library if it's installed, you can just use the import command.  Enter the following line of code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;import requests&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you'll have a collection of useful functions available to you in the requests namespace. The most important are &lt;code&gt;requests.get&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requests.post&lt;/code&gt; which, as you might expect, allow you to send GET and POST requests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you wanted to get the home page for this course.  You could run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;response = requests.get("https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com")&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will assign the HTTP response from the server for the course home page to a variable called "response."  This variable is an object provided by the Requests library that contains a bunch of useful methods and attributes. These include: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;response.text&lt;/code&gt; will give you the text of the webpage, in this case, a string of HTML code. 
&lt;code&gt;response.status_code&lt;/code&gt; will give you the status code of the response. Hopefully it's 200. 
&lt;code&gt;response.headers&lt;/code&gt; will give you a Dictionary containing all the headers of the response. So you can find out things like the Content-Type by asking for &lt;code&gt;response.headers["Content-Type"]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests also lets you send data with your get and post requests. Take a look at the Requests documentation to see how. It's pretty straightforward: &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#passing-parameters-in-urls"&gt;here's how to send ordinary data in a GET request&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#more-complicated-post-requests"&gt;here's how to send ordinary data in a POST request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;APIs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers talk a lot about APIs.  API stands for "application programming interface," and just means a set of commands that programmers make for other programmers to use.  Software has an API---for example, the fact that Requests gives you get and post functions is part of the API of the Requests library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet resources also have APIs.  The API of an internet resource typically describes the endpoints you can make requests to, the format those requests have to be in, and the kind of data you'll get back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there's a wonderful service called &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/"&gt;Courtlistener&lt;/a&gt; that contains massive amounts of case and court data from the American legal system. &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/#jurisdiction-endpoint"&gt;The documentation for their API&lt;/a&gt; explains how to get that information via programming. (The Courtlistener API is very complicated, and we won't be working with it too much in this class, but you should know it's out there.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I wanted to get some information from Courtlistener---say, I wanted to know the date that their database of Supreme Court opinions started.  Here's what I'd do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I'd sign up for an API key on the Courtlistener website. It's free for individual use, but you have to actually sign up, they don't just let you access things willy-nilly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documentation for the Courtlistener API gives instructions for how to authenticate with API keys---can you see where?  So I'd want to create some headers of the appropriate format, which &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers"&gt;Requests lets you do pretty easily&lt;/a&gt;.  Let's suppose my API key were "12345."  Here's what I'd do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Authorization&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Token 12345&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I'd make a request to the endpoint that has the basic information about the Supreme Court data they have.  As it turns out, that is https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/scotus/ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my next few lines of code would be: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;scotusresponse = requests.get(&amp;quot;https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest/v3/courts/scotus/&amp;quot;, headers=my_headers}
print(scotusresponse.json()[&amp;quot;start_date&amp;quot;])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that would (assuming my untested code is correct) give me the answer I wanted.  Try it yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;JSON format&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that &lt;code&gt;scotusresponse.json&lt;/code&gt; call in the code above. What's that? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSON is a plain-text data format that is very popular on the internet. If you look at a JSON file, it looks like a bunch of nested Python lists and dictionaries---and that's because that's basically what it is. Actually, it's almost identical to the syntax for the JavaScript equivalent of lists and dictionaries, because it's derived from JavaScript (JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation). For the most part, if you want to write Python lists and dictionaries to disk, you'll want to use JSON format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a built-in Python library called, unsurprisingly, "json" that has has functionality to read and write JSON files from disk or from strings in memory. But if you receive data from the network in JSON format using Requests, you can call the &lt;code&gt;.json()&lt;/code&gt; method on the response that you receive, and it'll kindly parse the JSON for you. ("Parse" means turn it from its representation as a JSON-formatted string into ordinary Python lists and dictionaries.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when you call the courts endpoint, Courtlistener sends back data in JSON format by default. So calling the &lt;code&gt;.json()&lt;/code&gt; method will turn that into a Python dict, and then, by looking at the documentation, we can see that the &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; key is the right one to look for in that dict to get the information we need---and there it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a lot to absorb right now---don't worry, we'll get some more practice with fetching data using code in class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Further information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most comprehensive and reliable source of information on all things HTTP is the Mozilla Developer's Network (MDN); further details on most of the information here can be found on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP"&gt;their page on HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about Python's built-in JSON library, you can use the &lt;a href="https://pymotw.com/3/json/"&gt;PYMOTW page on the subject&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability is the mathematical representation of the likelihood of an event under a given set of circumstances (conditions) in a given period of time. We will say, for example, that the probability of winning the jackpot in the lottery from buying one ticket this week is some (very tiny) number like .00000003.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also sometimes use probability language to refer to states of affairs---we might say, for example, that given what I know about the number of buses in town and the color of the bus that hit the plaintiff, the probability that the bus that hit the plaintiff belonged to the Acme Bus Company is .75. (This comes from a very famous thought experiment, described in Charles Nesson, The Evidence or the Event? On Judicial Proof and the Acceptability of Verdicts, 98 Harv. L. Rev. 1357 (1985))  Usually, you won't need to think too hard about the difference between these two ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We represent probability as a fraction between 0 and 1, where 0 means no chance that an event will happen, and 1 means that an event will definitely happen. If someone starts talking about a probability higher than 1 or lower than 0, they're either clueless or lying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, we express probability in decimals like .75 or percentages like 75%.  We can also express them in fractions like 3/4, but it's a little easy to confuse those with &lt;em&gt;odds&lt;/em&gt;, which is a different representation of probability, so we'll (mostly) be avoiding fractional probability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two big theoretical interpretations of probability, the frequentist and the Bayesian.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very broadly speaking, the frequentist interpretation of probability says that we are, as the name suggests, talking about frequencies. To say that you have a .75 chance of winning the lottery, to the frequentist, says that if if we picked a large number of groups of 100 people just like you, then we would expect that on average 75 people in each of those groups would win the lottery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the Bayesian interpretation is about subjective beliefs.  On the Bayesian interpretation, when I say that I have a subjective probability of .75 in winning the lottery, what I mean is that if I make a large number of predictions with a .75 probability, I expect them to be true about 75% of the time. That is, a Bayesian probability represents an attempt to quantify my level of uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you don't need to care about these different interpretations.  Statisticians and philosophers care about them a lot, but the practical implications of the two worldviews won't come up in much that lawyers need to deal with. Importantly, in a bit I'll introduce an idea called &lt;em&gt;Bayes Rule&lt;/em&gt;, but this is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a concept that is limited to Bayesians, frequentists recognize it too---it's a basic mathematical fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Probability math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A single event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of having an intuition for this kind of thing, you can think of the probability of a single event as just the proportional frequency of an event in the world of possible events under similar circumstances. If 5 of every 100 people who file suits for negligence win their cases at trial, then the probability of winning a negligence case at trial, assuming no other information, is .05. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually we express the probability of some event with a capital P, like P(Win your negligence suit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it's real easy to calculate the probability of a single event: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(event) = \frac{ways-that-event-can-happen}{ways-anything-can-happen}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose I have a jar of 30 marbles, and 3 of them are red. And suppose I draw exactly 1 marble. There are three ways I can pick a red marble, and 30 total ways I can pick any marble (if we interpret "grabbing a marble" as a "way"). Therefore, by the math above, the probability of getting a red marble is .1.  It's really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multiple Events&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real interesting kind of probability math is what happens when we consider multiple events. But before we dig into that math, we should first define some terms and simple rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Basic ideas and rules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, two (or more) events are &lt;strong&gt;independent&lt;/strong&gt; if they don't affect one another, or, put differently, if knowing about one of them doesn't affect our judgment about how probable the other is. For example, who I call on in Torts class and the winner of the Kentucky Derby are independent: horse races don't affect who I call on, and vice versa. (If you're a bit of a jerk, you might imagine degenerate cases where this might not be true. For example, suppose the owner of the winning horse is in my class, but quits law school after the race makes him/her rich? Or suppose my questions are so unkind that I demoralize one of the students, who quits law school to become a horse trainer? Fine, &lt;em&gt;in the ordinary course of events&lt;/em&gt; those two are independent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two (or more) events are &lt;strong&gt;mutually exclusive&lt;/strong&gt; if they cannot occur at the same time. For example, my becoming Pope and my being a Protestant are mutually exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of events is &lt;strong&gt;exhaustive&lt;/strong&gt; if they describe all possible events under the circumstances. For example, here is an exhaustive set of the relationships I might have with the University of Iowa College of Law: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a staff member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm an administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm a student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not affiliated with the law school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a set of events is mutually exclusive and exhaustive, then their probabilities always sum to 1. Think about our example: it's definitely true that I'm either faculty, staff, administrator, student, or not affiliated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An event and its &lt;strong&gt;complement&lt;/strong&gt; are always mutually exclusive and exhaustive. "Complement" is just a fancy set theory way of saying "add the word 'not' to the front of it." For example, the following two events are complements: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm king of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not king of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows that P(Gowder is king of the world) + P(Gowder is not king of the world) = 1, because, being complements, they're mutually exclusive and exhaustive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By some basic algebra, we also get &lt;strong&gt;the subtraction rule&lt;/strong&gt;: the probability of any event is just the probability of its complement, subtracted from 1. For example, if I have a .8 chance of being king of the world, then it follows that I have a 1 - .8 = .2 chance of not being king of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Alternative probabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For mutually exclusive events, we have &lt;strong&gt;the addition rule&lt;/strong&gt;: if A and B are mutually exclusive events, then the probability of one or the other being true is just equal to the sum of their individual probabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a concrete example: what's the probability of me being either Pope or a Protestant?  Well, let's suppose the probability of my being Pope is .00001, and the probability of my being Protestant is .05. Then the probability of my being either Pope or Protestant is .05001, the sum P(Pope) + P(Protestant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In set-theory language, this "or" relationship is called the &lt;strong&gt;union&lt;/strong&gt; of the two events; in other words, the probability that either A or B occurs is called the probability of the union of A and B is denoted: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cup B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The addition rule can be extended to the case where A and B are not mutually exclusive. Under those circumstances, the probability that either A or B occurs is just the sum of the probability of A plus the probability of B, &lt;em&gt;minus&lt;/em&gt; the probability of both A and B happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of both A and B happening also has a set theory term and notation. It's called the &lt;strong&gt;intersection&lt;/strong&gt; of A and B, and is denoted: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our expanded addition rule can then be expressed in mathematical notation as following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we can derive the shorter version of the addition rule that we started with from the longer version I just gave you. If two events are mutually exclusive, then the probability of their union is 0, so the third term in that longer equation just drops away, leaving us with the shorter version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Joint Probabilities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we calculate the intersection of probabilities?  The intersection is also known as the joint probability of events A and B. To remind you, that just means the probability that both are true at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If A and B are independent, the intersection is just the product of the probabilities of each. This is the &lt;strong&gt;multiplication rule&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example. Suppose I flip a coin twice. Each coin flip is an independent event. So what's the probability of my getting heads twice? Let's reason through it in words. Half of the time, I get heads on the first flip. Then, &lt;em&gt;half of that first half&lt;/em&gt; I get heads on the second flip. Put differently, I flip two coins every day for 100 days, I expect that on roughly 50 of those days I'll get heads the first time. And then on roughly half of those 50 days, or 25 days, I'll get a second head too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;An immediate application&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of joint probability reveals a potential puzzle in the law. Suppose a trial finishes in a case that hinges on two independent factual issues. For example, suppose we have a toxic tort case. Defendant denies that the chemical produced by its plant was in the water supply, but also denies that the chemical could, as a matter of biology, have caused the ill effects plaintiff suffered. Plaintiff needs to prove both of those things in order to win, but the probability of one being true is not affected by the probability of the other being true (whether the chemical is poisonous doesn't affect whether it was in the water supply, and vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose a juror, based on the evidence presented by plaintiff, assigns a subjective probability of .7 to the chemical being in the water supply, and also assigns a subjective probability of .7 to the chemical's being poisonous. Should she vote for a verdict for the plaintiff? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it's not clear. If the rule is "plaintiff must prove every individual fact at issue by a preponderance of the evidence," then it looks like plaintiff wins: it's more likely than not that the chemical was in the water supply, and it's more likely than not that it's poisonous. On the other hand, if the rule is "plaintiff must prove all the facts at issue by a preponderance of the evidence," then it sounds like we're concerned with the &lt;em&gt;joint&lt;/em&gt; probability of the two claims, i.e. .7 * .7 = .49. Whoops, that's less than half! Plaintiff loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has actually been the object of some discussion in academic journals. &lt;em&gt;See, e.g.&lt;/em&gt;, Edward K. Cheng, &lt;em&gt;Reconceptualizing the Burden of Proof&lt;/em&gt;, 122 &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;Yale L. J.&lt;/span&gt; 1254 (2013) (calling this the "conjunction paradox" and proposing one possible solution). &lt;em&gt;See also&lt;/em&gt; Ronald J. Allen &amp;amp; Alex Stein, &lt;em&gt;Evidence, Probability and the Burden of Proof&lt;/em&gt;, 55 &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;Ariz. L. Rev.&lt;/span&gt; 557 (2013) (excellent discussion of related problems and literature on same; claiming that practical adjudication rarely involves making probabilistic calculations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides all kind of opportunities for the skillful lawyer who isn't afraid of math. Suppose you're defense counsel, and plaintiff's experts have testified that the probability of those factual issues is each .7. The moment plaintiff rests, if you understand probability, you should instantly move for a directed verdict and argue for the judge to apply the all-the-facts rule. You might not win, especially if those scholars who argue that the preponderance of the evidence standard isn't probabilistic are right, but it's a sufficiently compelling argument to be well worth trying. This is also something that you could argue to the jury, or try to get in a jury instruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if events aren't independent?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conditional Probabilities&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important probability topics to understand, and one that people frequently get wrong---sometimes to dire consequences---is conditional probability. Conditional probability is what we need when we realize that some events are not independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conditional probability of some event A, given some other event B, is just the probability of A &lt;em&gt;taking into account the fact that non-independent event B happened&lt;/em&gt;. It expresses the effect that one event happens on the probability of another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the probability that I'll get a concussion today is pretty low, but the probability that I'll get a concussion &lt;em&gt;given&lt;/em&gt; that I play for the Hawkeyes and there's a football game today is much higher. If we're trying to make judgments about my likelihood of getting a head injury, it would be pretty stupid to fail to take into account that I'm involved in an activity that primarily involves gigantic people bashing my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mathematical notation for conditional probability is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vertical line signifies the conditional nature of the relationship, i.e., the probability of B conditional on A (imagine B as the concussion, and A as my playing in a football game). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a simple formula for calculating conditional probabilities. I'll give you the math first, and then we'll talk through it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formula is known as &lt;strong&gt;Bayes Rule&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimes Bayes Theorem or Bayes law, and sometimes we stick an apostrophe in there). It's super-important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In words: the probability of event B conditional on event A is the product of the probability of event A conditional on event B and the probability of event B, all divided by the probability of event A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a concrete example. Suppose you want to know the probability that I'm a football player, given that I have a concussion. Here's how you'd calculate it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Football|Concussion) = \frac{P(Concussion|Football)P(Football)}{P(Concussion)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's get some numbers up in this exploitative college sport/financial scam. Assume that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of my having a concussion, given that I'm a football player, is .5: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Concussion|Football) = .5$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of my being a football player without knowing anything else about me (the "base rate" of football players in the population, or, to Bayesians, the "prior" that you have in my being a football player) is, blessedly, low, say .01: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Football) = .01$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probability of my having a concussion without knowing anything else about me (the base rate of concussions) is also pretty low, let's call that .03: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Concussion) = .03$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then we can just plug the numbers into our Bayes' Rule equation and come up with our answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Football|Concussion) = \frac{(0.5)(0.01)}{(0.03)} = 0.17$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, that equation represents the additional information you get about whether I'm likely to be a football player, as a result of learning that I have a concussion. If you're a Bayesian, we'd say that you now have .17 subjective probability in my being a football player, as opposed to merely .01 before (your "posterior probability" as opposed to your "prior probability"); if you're a frequentist you'd say that you expect about 17% of the people you meet who have concussions to be football players, as opposed to 1% of people in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Independence and Joint Probability Revisited.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the notion of conditional probability, we can go back and state a formal definition of independence. Events A and B are independent if: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A) = P(A|B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, they're independent if whether or not B happens doesn't affect A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to practice your algebra, you can prove that if the condition above is true, it's also true that: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B) = P(B|A)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: try plugging stuff into Bayes Rule and then factoring stuff out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another (equivalent) definition of independence is that A and B are independent if: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's just the multiplication rule flipped around, if you understand our coin flipping example you understand why that's true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also conclude that the conditional probability of an event given its complement is 0. There are lots of ways to write this (complement notation doesn't seem to be particularly standardized), but here's one way: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A|\overline{A}) = 0$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, because we know that if not-X happened, then X definitely didn't happen. The conditional probability of my being king of the world, given that I'm not king of the world, has to be zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the notion of conditional probability, we can also get a formula for calculating the joint probability of dependent events. Where A and B are dependent (that is, &lt;em&gt;not independent&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just our earlier multiplication rule for joint probability again: we multiply the probability of A by the probability of A given B to get the joint probability of A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how we can derive our original version of the multiplication rule (for independent events) from this expanded version. If A and B are independent, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B) = P(B|A)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hence we can substitute that into the above equation, and get our original multiplication rule: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic example to understand the reasoning behind the expanded multiplication rule is drawing cards. If you draw cards from a normal deck and don't put them back, then the probability of the first card being a heart is just 13/52 = 1/4. What's the probability of drawing a second heart? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, imagine that instead of drawing from the same deck, someone just gave you a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; deck of cards with 51 cards in it, 12 of which were hearts. We know the probability of drawing a heart in that second deck, right? 12/51. That world is just the world described by the conditional probability of drawing a second heart given that you've already drawn a first. So what's the probability of drawing a heart out of the normal deck and a heart out of the weird second deck? Easy: 1/4 * 12/51.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also chain this rule, i.e.: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A)P(B | A)P(C | (A \cap B))$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the probability of drawing a third heart in a row. And then a fourth, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conditional independence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the real world, full-fledged independence is pretty rare. But conditional independence---two events being independent conditional on a third variable---is much more common and just as useful.  Here's an example of conditional independence: having multiple concussions and weighing more than 300 pounts  might be independent conditional on being a football player.  That is, given I know someone is a football player, I don't learn anything more about whether they're likely to have multiple concussions from knowing they're really big, or vice versa.  Formally speaking, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(concussions | football, gigantic) = P(concussions | football)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(gigantic | football, concussions) = P(gigantic | football)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is that two variables can be conditionally independent on some third variable without being independent. If I see someone really huge walking around campus, I do learn something about the likelihood of them having had multiple concussions---because really big people are more likely to be football players, and football players are more likely, in turn, to suffer multiple concussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about conditional independence is the multiplication rule still works.  That is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P((gigantic \cap concussions) | football) = P(gigantic | football)P(concussions | football)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Collection of Common Mistakes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a bunch of frequent errors that people make with probability. Don't make them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ignoring Base Rates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first mistake is just not getting the whole Bayes thing, like, at all. Consider this classic example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose there's a medical test for some disease, and let's say that it has a 95% accuracy rate. To be more precise, let's say that 95% of the time it says what it should say, given the state of the world: if a patient has the disease, 95% of the time it returns a positive result; if the patient does not have the disease, 95% of the time it returns a negative result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note on statistical lingo you might see floating around: a Type I error is a "false positive," i.e., if the machine sees someone without the disease and returns a positive result; a Type II error is a "false negative," i.e., if the machine sees someone with the disease and returns a negative result. For simplicity, we're assuming here that the test has identical Type I and Type II error rates.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're a doctor, and you administer that test to a patient. It reads positive. &lt;em&gt;Are you justified in concluding that there's a 95% chance they have the disease?&lt;/em&gt;  The answer is "no, not without first taking into account what proportion of people have the disease ('the base rate')."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's work through this problem.  We can do it in two ways. Both ways require making an assumption about the base rate of the disease in the population. So let's suppose that 2% of the people in the population have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we'll talk through it using our intuitions. Suppose we test 1000 people. 20 of them will have the disease. Of those, the machine will correctly identify 19, so it'll return 19 positive results and 1 negative result. 980 of our 1000 people will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have the disease, but our 95% accuracy machine will only identify 931 of those correctly: it'll return 931 negative results and 49 positive results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So out of our 1000 people, we'll get a total of 68 positive results. Of those results, only 19 of the people will have the disease. That's only about 28% (after some rounding)! So you can only conclude that an individual person has a 28% chance of having the disease, not a 95% chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's do this a bit more formally using Bayes' Rule. This will require some thinking. We want to know the probability of the patient having the disease, given that s/he tested positive. We know the probability of the patient testing positive, given that s/he has the disease (.95), and we know the base rate probability of the patient having the disease (.02), but we seem to be missing a term in our equation: we don't know the base rate probability of getting a positive result on the test. Or do we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, we can calculate it simply by exhaustively describing the possible states of the world. After all, we know that a patient can only have or not-have the disease. Therefore, we know (by the addition rule) that the probability of the test being positive is just the sum of the probability of the two mutually exclusive states of affairs in which it can be positive: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P((Positive | Disease) \cap Disease) + P((Positive | Healthy) \cap Healthy)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we know how to calculate these unions. They're all going to be independent events, so we just apply the multiplication rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this concrete, let's imagine a patient. 98% of the time, the patient does not have the disease, and 5% of that 98% time, that patient will get a positive result. 2% of the time, the patient will have the disease, and 95% of that 2% time, that patient will get a positive result. So then we can calculate the base rate of the machine returning positive as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Positive) = (.98 * .05) + (.02 * .95) = .068$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can plug this all right into Bayes' Rule: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(Disease|Positive) = \frac{P(Positive|Disease)P(Disease)}{P(Positive)} = \frac{(.95)(.02)}{(.068)} ~ .28$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, this is the same result we got before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine this reasoning applied in common legal contexts. Do defense lawyers know the relevant error rates of breathalyzer machines, and the base rate of drunk driving in the population? Let's hope so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Conjunction Fallacy.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another classic probability oopsie: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Linda is a teacher in elementary school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Linda works in a bookstore and takes Yoga classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Linda is active in the feminist movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Linda is a psychiatric social worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) Linda is a member of the League of Women Voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f) Linda is a bank teller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g) Linda is an insurance salesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to rank these statements in order of probability, the "great majority" of people said that (h) is more probable than (f), according to Amos Tversky &amp;amp; Daniel Kahneman, &lt;em&gt;Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment,&lt;/em&gt; 90  &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;Psychological Rev.&lt;/span&gt; 293 (1983). (I've slightly modified the example given in that paper to more clearly enumerate the options.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem with that judgment: it's &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;.  Remember that probabilities lie on the range 0-1 inclusive, and that the joint probability of two independent events is the product of their individual probabilities. It follows that the &lt;em&gt;maximum&lt;/em&gt; probability of Linda being active in the feminist movement is 1, in which case &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(h) = P(f)\)&lt;/span&gt;; in all other possible cases, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(h) &amp;lt; P(f)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note that there's been a ton of debate on the original study, mainly focused on whether experimental subjects really understood (f) to be talking about P(Bank teller) alone and whether they understood (h) to be asking about the conjunction independent events P(Bank teller) and P(Feminist). There have been lots of replication attempts for this experiment in slightly different forms in order to nail it down. If you're worried about them, go read the literature. For present purposes, I just want you to see the error: joint probabilities of independent events can never be more than the individual probability of the least probable individual event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Monty Hall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a famous puzzle called the "Monty Hall Problem." It goes like this: imagine you're in a game show, and the host invites you to pick from three closed doors. One of the doors holds a fancy new sports car, and the other two hold goats. (Let us suppose, perhaps counterfactually, that you prefer a sports car to a goat.) After you choose, the host opens one of the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; doors, always to reveal a goat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now you've picked a door, and the host shows you a goat behind one of the other doors. I want to emphasize this, because it's very important: &lt;em&gt;the host knows what door has the car, and s/he always opens a door you didn't choose, and it's always a goat door&lt;/em&gt;. Then the host asks if you want to stick with your original choice, or switch to the remaining closed door. If you want to get the sports car, should you stay or switch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 1990, Marilyn vos Savant, who apparently occupies the spot in the Guinness World Record book for "highest IQ," published this problem in a magazine, and declared that the correct answer was to always switch. In response, many, many people, including a number of mathematicians, blew their stacks and wrote angry letters telling her how wrong she was. (To be fair, her original description of the problem was a bit ambiguous about what the host knows and whether the host always revealed a goat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how you might (incorrectly) reason to conclude that she was wrong. At the start of the game, each door had a .33[3333...] chance of having the sports car behind it. Initially, you picked a door at random, so you have a .33 chance of being right to stick. The remaining door also had a .33 chance of being the one with a sports car behind it. Nothing about what the host did changed those probabilities, so you have an equal chance of getting the sports car whether you stick with your original choice or switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, here's the correct way to reason. The host actually gave you additional information when s/he opened the door. Originally, your choice (call it the A-door) had a .33 chance of being correct, and hence a .66[6666666...] chance of the sports car being in one of the two remaining doors (call them the B-doors). So now the host has ruled out one of the B-doors for you, you still know that there's a .33 chance of the car being behind the A-door and a .66 chance of the car being behind the B-doors... but the number of B-doors has been reduced from 2 to 1! So there's a .66 chance of the car behind behind the one door left. You should switch. (Exercise for the reader: use Bayes' rule to prove this mathematically.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a famously difficult problem, and the vast majority of people initially tend to pick the wrong answer. It tends to break our ordinary intuitions, and as a result serves as an excellent demonstration of the fact that you really can't trust your intuitive judgments when it comes to probability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you still don't believe me (and I understand if you don't), you can see this explanation paired with a computer simulation of switching and sticking strategies at &lt;a href="http://paul-gowder.com/montyhall/"&gt;http://paul-gowder.com/montyhall/&lt;/a&gt; --- which even includes a link to a mathematical explanation (but really, try to do that part yourself before following the link).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another way to think of the problem (with thanks to my friend Corey Yanofsky): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host never offers you the chance to switch; you win 1/3 of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host offers, you're stubborn and never switch: always produces the same outcome as if the host never gave you a chance to switch. Hence 1/3 of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always switch: wins whenever a stubborn player would lose and loses whenever the stubborn player would win; therefore the switcher wins 2/3 of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's still another way to think of the problem: suppose instead of 3 doors, there are 100 doors, and the host opens 98 of them. Does switching seem more plausible now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Application: Expected Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists define the expected value of a risk as the sum of the probabilities of every possible result of that risk, multiplied by their value. For example, suppose you buy a lottery ticket with a 1% chance of a 10,000 dollar payoff and a 10% chance of a 100 dollar payoff, and otherwise you get nothing. Then the expected value (in dollars) is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$.01 * 10000 + .1 * 100 = 110$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For purposes of valuing options, outcomes with identical expected values are usually treated as equal. For example, it would be roughly equivalent to pay $110 (give up a 100% chance at $110) for that lottery ticket, because that trade is equal expected value. (This is not to say that any actual person would be willing to make that trade. Some people are "risk averse" -- they might only be willing to pay, say, $100 for that lottery ticket, because they don't want to take the risk of ending up with nothing. Others, like gamblers, might be risk-seeking: people in Vegas regularly pay more than the expected value for the lotteries they play.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Loss of a Chance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's work through a common torts problem. Suppose that a plaintiff experiences a loss in probability of something as a result of the defendant's negligence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose that the plaintiff went into the defendant doctor's clinic complaining of leg pain. The patient actually has an infection, but the doctor negligently misdiagnoses it as early-stage arthritis and tells the patient to just take some aspirin. A week later, the patient comes back complaining of much worse pain. This time, the doctor can't miss the infection, and rushes the patient into the ER for a massive dose of antibiotics. Unfortunately, it's too late, and the patient loses the leg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're a juror at trial, and you hear credible expert testimony suggesting that the plaintiff had a 60% chance of keeping the leg if the doctor had administered appropriate treatment at the first visit, but that went down to 10% by the time of the second visit. You also hear credible expert testimony placing the economic, emotional, etc. value of a lost leg at $500,000. Can you use the idea of expected value to calculate plaintiff's damages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one way you might want to do it. At the time of the first visit, absent negligence, the expected value the plaintiff had in the possible states of affairs relating to that leg was .6 * 500000 + .4 * 0 = $300,000. At the time of the second visit, the expected value the plaintiff had in the leg was .1 * 500000 + .9 * 0 = 50,000. Therefore, the plaintiff suffered a net loss in expected value terms of $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, it turns out that lots of cases don't go down this way. First of all, many courts would consider the plaintiff's actual injury to be a reduction to 0% rather than 10% of the value of the leg, based on the principle that the defendant is responsible for the actual foreseeable injury that plaintiff suffers as a result of his/her negligent conduct, no matter how likely or unlikely. But second, while some courts award proportional damages that aim at something like the expected value of the lost probability of plaintiff's avoiding damages, there are also cases awarding full damages in this situation, and other cases awarding no damages. Sometimes this has depended on whether the original chance was greater or less than 50%. Some courts engage in some loose talk about whether the negligence was a "substantial factor" in the ultimate harm, which basically means "punt and let the jury figure it out." Courts do all kinds of weird math. The doctrine is a mess. (An extended summary can be found in Tory A. Weigand, &lt;em&gt;Loss of Chance in Medical Malpractice: The Need for Caution&lt;/em&gt;, 87 &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps;"&gt;Massachusetts Law Review&lt;/span&gt; n. 1 (2002), online &lt;a href="http://www.massbar.org/publications/massachusetts-law-review/2002/v87-n1/loss-of-chance-in-medical"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) Should you find yourself with such a case, it's critical to know your jurisdiction's law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe if more lawyers actually understand how probability work, we can get the doctrine sorted out one day. Such, at least, is the dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some more examples of probability in the law&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law is shot through with ideas about probability, uncertainty, risk, and chance. Consider the following examples, all from core law school courses, and most from the first year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warrants and arrests must be supported by "probable cause."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A civil plaintiff must ordinarily prove her case by a "preponderance" of the evidence, which is usually understood to mean that the elements of her case are more likely than not to be true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FRE 401(a) provides that the first element of the test for relevant evidence is that "it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In criminal law as well as in torts, we say that one the rationales for punishment is deterrence, that is, to make doing harm to others too costly to the defendant to be worth doing. The usual way we calculate the deterrent value of a punishment is probabilistically: we say (roughly) that ideal deterrence should set the product of the cost of the punishment and the probability of having that punishment inflicted to be equal to the harm done to others by the punishable act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In torts, the Hand formula for breach of the duty of care in negligence cases, BPL, is meant to capture the burden of taking a precaution, balanced against the probability that the loss will occur absent that precaution as well as the cost of the loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Footnote on Odds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds is the gambling-style representation of probability, like "4 to 1" and so forth. "4 to 1 odds that e" means "the event E is 4 times as likely as Not-E," which translates to ordinary probability language as an 0.8 probability of E. It's easy to convert from odds back to decimal probability.  It's easy to convert back and forth from odds to probability. In order to do so, let's represent odds with a doublecolon (sometimes it gets represented as a fraction, but that just makes the notation super confusing and I refuse to do it) such that A to B odds is A::B. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To go from odds to probability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$A::B = \frac{A}{A + B}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in our example, "4 to 1 odds" converts to probability as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(4::1 = \frac{4}{4 + 1} = \frac{4}{5} = .8\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, odds isn't exactly the same thing as a representation of probability, it's technically defined as a different concept derived from probability.  So we can represent our 4:1 odds as the fraction &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{4}{1}\)&lt;/span&gt; and actually treat it like a fraction, for example, and simplify it to 4.  Then we could say "odds of 4" which is equivalent to saying "probability of .8."  But I'll just use the double colon notation to keep it clear what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What odds really are is the probability of the event divided by the probability of not the event.  Which means that conversion from odds to probability is as simply as computing that.  Assign the variable P to the probability of our event, and then odds are just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\frac{P}{1-P}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, people in the sciences talk about probability rather than odds. People in gambling talk about odds, and some Bayesian statisticians do as well, mainly because it makes a few computations easier. In this course, we'll almost entirely talk about probability, not odds (with one brief exception toward the end). &lt;/p&gt;

It’s actually very simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you do an experiment. Let’s say you want to find out whether a company is engaging in racial discrimination in interviewing, so you manufacture a bunch of resumes and then send them out with randomly changed names, street addresses (in a racially segregated city), and other markers of racial identification. This is a kind of study that &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0002828042002561"&gt;economists actually do&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now suppose you find out that, say, white-appearing resumes get interviews 10% of the time, while black-appearing resumes get interviews 8% of the time.  Is this fact alone enough to show that the company engages in discrimination? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one worry you might have is that this difference is just the result of bad luck.  Maybe, just by sheer coincidence, more of the black-appearing resumes landed on harsher recruiters’ desks, or showed up in the mail just before lunch, when people were hungry and impatient and crabby. You need statistics to quantify the likelihood that the difference you saw was just the result of chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s one way you might think of the problem. Let’s assume what we saw, i.e., that the real-world (population) average (that is, mean) number of interviews that white-appearing applicants get per 100 resumes is 10. Suppose as a hypothesis (this is the famous &lt;strong&gt;null hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;) that the real-world mean number of interviews that black-appearing resumes get is &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; 10.  How likely is it that we would have actually seen black-appearing resumes only yield 8 interviews in a sample?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central limit theorem gets us most of the way to the answer: recall that it says that the sample mean will be normally distributed around the mean of the actual population. So &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; the population mean of interviews for black-appearing resumes is actually 10 (that is, if there’s no discrimination), how likely is it that we’ll actually see 8 in our sample?  Well, that depends on the standard deviation of the sample mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calculation of that quantity is a topic for another lesson. (This is just a conceptual introduction, remember?) The important thing to know right now is that it will get smaller as sample size increases. (Think about that in light of our lesson on the central limit theorem again: with a larger sample size, it’s more likely that the sample mean will correspond to the population mean; so a population full of large sizes will on the whole have less dispersion around the sample mean than a population full of small sample sizes will. This is just the law of large numbers.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s suppose that the standard deviation of the sample mean is 0.5.  Then our observation is four standard deviations out from the mean. We know from the properties of the normal distribution that if the mean of interviews for black-appearing resumes really is 10 and the standard deviation of the sample means is .5, only a very small percentage of possible samples would be as low as 8. So we have some good evidence that discrimination is happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, if the standard deviation is 2, well, then it’s only one standard deviation away. We know that in a normal distribution upwards of 30% of observations will fall one standard deviation or more away--so our result shouldn’t give us much reason to think that discrimination is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the essence of hypothesis testing. In its classical form, we pick a threshold value---95% is a common one---and we figure out the distribution that applies to the statistic (like mean, or variance, or whatever) that we’re trying to figure out (it isn’t always normal, because we aren’t always just trying to figure out the mean, and actually &lt;a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/85804/choosing-between-z-test-and-t-test"&gt;we usually use a slightly different distribution called the t distribution anyway&lt;/a&gt;---more on this later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we pick a null hypothesis---a description of the quantity we would expect to see if there’s nothing interesting going on (no discrimination, the drug has no effect, etc), and we look at our data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the statistic in question is far enough away from what we would expect the statistic to be under the null hypothesis, then we count that as evidence that the null hypothesis isn’t true---that there is something going on. "Far enough" is defined by our threshold value: if we pick a value of 95%, it means that we’ll only count the data as evidence of something if the statistic of interest is so extreme that it’s outside the range that we would expect 95% of samples to fall in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The infamous p-value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 95% example we just gave is also the source of the "p-value." Once we see how many standard deviations our sample is from the null hypothesis statistic, we know how big a chunk of the distribution of possible observations the observation we got is out of. And we get our p-value from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example. If we see a mean that is two standard deviations away from the null hypothesis mean, we know that we would expect 95.4% of observations to be closer to the null mean. To get a p-value, we just turn that to a decimal and subtract it from 1: we would say that we have a p value of 0.046.  With a standard significance threshold of 0.05 (the equivalent of our 95% threshold value above), we’d say that the p-value is low enough for statistical significance---for us to think we’ve detected a real effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story I just told is a very conventional, classical, approach to hypothesis testing. Unfortunately, it tends to be misinterpreted and misused a lot. We’ll talk more down the line about how this goes wrong, but here is one quick warning to start with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Watch out for p-hacking.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if you take a bunch of samples? For example, suppose you have 20 different ways to formulate the null hypothesis or to analyze the data, and you try them all. 19 of them don’t turn out to be significant at an 0.05 level, but one of them does. Does this mean you have a real result?  You should be able to see that it probably doesn’t: if an 0.05 significance level means that you should see a result this extreme 5% of the time even if the null hypothesis is true, well, dude, you just did 20 tests, and you saw it once... that is 5% of the time! You have effectively no evidence here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People intentionally or unintentionally cheat like this all the time---it’s called &lt;strong&gt;p-hacking&lt;/strong&gt;.  Another way of p-hacking is to not have a "stopping rule"---to analyze the data while you’re collecting it, and then to stop collecting data when you see a significant result. Many scientists "preregister" their studies by publicly committing to the data they will collect and the analyses they will run in advance. This is a good practice to head off p-hacking. &lt;a href="https://www.methodspace.com/primer-p-hacking/"&gt;This blog post has a good explanation of p-hacking and preregistration&lt;/a&gt; (And actually, even if you don’t cheat like this, the chances that you incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis even with a p value of 0.05 is still substantially higher than 5%, because of Bayes Rule: see &lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/not-all-p-values-are-created-equal"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation of why.)&lt;/p&gt;

Mr. Able says, “I have two children …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right at the beginning of the F&amp;amp;L readings for this week, you saw a well-known probability puzzler/"paradox."  I'm going to risk angering the copyright gods and quote it in full here: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume that boys and girls are born with equal frequency. Mr. Able says, “I have two children, and at least one of them is a boy.” What is the probability that the other child is a boy? Mr. Baker says, “I went to the house of a two-child family, and a boy answered the door.” What is the probability that the other child is a boy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The readings then assert to you that the answer to Mr. Able's problem is 1/3, and the answer to Mr. Baker's problem is 1/2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll bet you have trouble believing this.  But it's correct.  Here's one way to think about why: &lt;strong&gt;probability statements are really sensitive to how you carve up the problem space&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abel problem could be restated as follows: first, take all the possible families with two kids, and then eliminate those where both are girls.  Then, just from the set of families remaining, what proportion of them have two boys?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baker problem could be restated as follows: first, take all the possible families with two kids. Of them, go knock on their doors, and, from those doors you knocked on in which a boy answers, in what proportion of them is the second kid a boy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is that the sets you're looking into are different.  In the Abel problem, you're looking at &lt;em&gt;every family that has a boy&lt;/em&gt; and asking how likely it is that those families have two boys. In the Baker problem, you're looking at &lt;em&gt;every family that has a boy AND where that boy happened to answer the door&lt;/em&gt;, and asking how likely it is that those families have two boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would expect the size of the set you're looking at in the Baker problem to be smaller. After all, there are some families that have both a boy and a girl for which the girl will happen to answer the door. Intuitively, this should suggest to you that the pool of families for which a boy has answered the door would be smaller and, importantly, more weighted toward families with more boys.  After all, in a boy/girl family, there's only a 50% chance that a boy will answer the door, whereas in a boy/boy family it's guaranteed that a boy will answer. So constructing our set of families where a boy answers means we lose some of the boy/girl families but none of the boy/boy families (we can safely assume no parents answer in any event since parent answering would be independent of which gender of the child answers and what genders there are among children in the family).  The pool will be relatively more full of boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now let's do the math.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's formalize the Baker problem with Bayes Rule. Reminder: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want to know is the probability of both kids being a boy, conditional on the door being opened by a boy. So, in our equation above, assign both-kids-boy to B, and boy-opened-door to A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's what we do know: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of door being opened by a boy, conditional on both kids being boys --- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A|B) = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of both kids being boys --- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(B) = 1/4\)&lt;/span&gt; because the available packages of kids are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{bg, gb, bb, gg\}\)&lt;/span&gt; and they have equal probability, and we know that as mutually exclusive and exhaustive events they must sum to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of the door being opened by a boy, or &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A)\)&lt;/span&gt;.  This one we have to do a little bit more work to construct. Let's reason it through.  We know all of the available packages of kids (that is, events), which are mutually exclusive. And we know the probability of each of those packages appearing (1/4).  We also know the probability of getting a boy to answer the door under each of the packages of kids. So we can just multiply those probabilities out and add them per the rules of probability we've already established. For example, the probability of bg is .25, and the probability of getting a boy answering the door there is 1/2, and so forth.  We ultimately end up with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A) = .25 \cdot .5 + .25 \cdot .5 + .25 \cdot 1 + .25 \cdot 0 = .5\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can plug in: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{1 \cdot .25}{.5} = \frac{1}{2}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as the readings told us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about the Abel problem?  Well, we don't even need Bayes Rule for this one, we just need to observe that 1/3 of the families with one boy have both boys. But let's do it anyway, just as an exercise. Set B to be, yet again, "family has both boys," and set A to be "family has one boy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of a family having one boy, conditional on their having both boys --- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A|B) = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of a family having both boys --- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(B) = 1/4\)&lt;/span&gt; because, again, our available packages of kids are &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\{bg, gb, bb, gg\}\)&lt;/span&gt;, with equal probability, and their probabilities have to all add up to 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability of a family having one boy --- &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A) = 3/4\)&lt;/span&gt; because of 4 available equal probability packages only one of which has no boys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, plug that sucker into Bayes rule: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{1 \cdot .25}{.75} = \frac{1}{3}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the readings did not lie to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should take several important lessons from forcing ourselves to work out this example all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clear talking facilitates clear thinking. With any probability statement, precise mathematical formulation is better than words, and more detailed words are better than less detailed words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probability statements are sensitive to the sample space (as the reading points out), or, more colloquially, the set of possible events being looked at.  Make absolutely sure you have a clear idea what that sample space is, and whether it's the correct one or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost any supposed paradox that you see can be resolved with aggressive application of Bayes Rule. Bayes Rule is the closest thing we have to a magic wand for fixing screwed-up thinking about probability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt about some probability statement, simulate it!  You just did a ton of work learning basic coding, it's time to get some payoff from it.  The great thing about simulations is that they force you to make your assumptions explicit by putting them in a form the computer can understand. If you can't define your sample space, you can't ask our good friend Python to simulate it. Often, writing out a simulation will force you to resolve ambiguities in how you structure the problem, and give you the boost you need to understand it yourself.  And if you still aren't quite sure even after writing the simulation out, you can run it and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written a simulation of the Able/Baker problem down below. Before you look at it, you might consider writing your own simulation. But if you don't have time, feel free to run my code with sufficiently large values and see what you get. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As your reward for reading this far, I'll tell you a secret.  I wasn't sure why the Able/Baker problem came out the way it does either---not until I wrote the simulation code. But, just as I said, writing this code forced me to think about what the sample space for the Baker problem actually is, and hence guided me to the rest of this explanation. Even those of us with years and years of probability experience need a little help sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if you’re doing a (two-sided) z test, your statistic is the mean, your null hypothesis mean is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the mean you observe in your sample is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\bar{x}\)&lt;/span&gt;, then the p-value is the probability of getting a mean at least &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu - \bar{x}\)&lt;/span&gt; units away from the mean when randomly sampling from a normal distribution with mean &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mu\)&lt;/span&gt; and standard deviation estimated by the formula for the standard deviation of a sample. (We’ll talk about that formula later, but if you want a sneak preview, check out &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/summarizing-quantitative-data/variance-standard-deviation-sample/a/population-and-sample-standard-deviation-review"&gt;this Khan Academy article&lt;/a&gt;.) If the p-value is below a predetermined level, often 0.05, then we say that there’s a statistically significant result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pause for a moment and ask yourself the following question: &lt;strong&gt;Does that mean the p-value is the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis?&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t go on until you have an answer, and can explain why you have that answer. This is very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that’s called a "Type I error" in some circles: the error of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis, a.k.a. (if you’re sensible and don’t like double negatives) convincing yourself that you’re seeing a real effect when you’re not. So the question above could be rephrased: "Is the p-value the probability of making a Type I error?"  A Type II error is the opposite: failing to reject the null hypothesis when you oughta, or, in other words, seeing a real effect and not realizing it. There’s a particularly good meme that captures this distinction and makes it impossible to forget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmZzvsY_Tec/Vws0f4MJn9I/AAAAAAAAORs/gipKxA7aDboP0gx2vSmyQS_ZoVBPzqaWA/s1600/Type%2BI%2Band%2BII%2Berror.jpg" alt="Type I and Type II errors" width="100%"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what’s your answer?  I’ll make some more space just to make sure you have a chance to figure it out for yourself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to my question is &lt;strong&gt;no.&lt;/strong&gt; Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go back to the definition I gave you of p-values, you’ll see that it’s really a conditional probability. The p value is the probability of seeing the data in your sample, conditional on the null hypothesis being true. In symbols: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$PValue = P(DataSeen|NullHypothesis)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what you'd really like to know is the probability of making a Type I error--the probability of making a mistake and declaring that you’ve discovered something that isn’t. Unfortunately, that can be rephrased as &lt;strong&gt;the probability of the null hypothesis being true, conditional on seeing your data!&lt;/strong&gt;  In symbols: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(TypeIError) = P(NullHypothesis|DataSeen)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, you should know that you can’t flip conditional probabilities around like that. Yet this is an incredibly common mistake--even actual statistics teachers sometimes slip up and say that the p-value is the probability of making a Type I error.  It isn’t!  Never say this! Never think this! Never respect anyone who does say or think it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an intuitive way of thinking about the problem. A statistically significant p-value means "if the null hypothesis were true, it would be unlikely that I'd have seen a sample that looks like that." There are some &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/popclock/"&gt;328 million&lt;/a&gt; U.S. citizens, and 535 members of Congress. So, if you randomly sample 100 Americans without replacement, it's really unlikely that they're all going to be members of Congress.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How unlikely? Well, we'll want the number of possible samples of 100 members of Congress, divided by the number of possible 100-person samples: that's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\({535\choose 100}\)&lt;/span&gt; divided by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\({328,000,000\choose 100}\)&lt;/span&gt; which is... a lot. Let's not try and do this by hand, eh?  (The parens mean, e.g., "535 choose 100"---see &lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1688391/probability-of-picking-4-red-balls"&gt;this explanation&lt;/a&gt; of the general process of reasoning here. Here's the &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.comb.html#scipy.special.comb"&gt;Python function&lt;/a&gt; we're going to use.). This produces a probability so small that we have to use a fancy arbitrary precision math library called &lt;code&gt;mpmath&lt;/code&gt; to get it to actually do the division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;scipy.special&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;comb&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;mpmath&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;numerator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mpmath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;535&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;denominator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mpmath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;comb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;328000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;exact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="n"&gt;numerator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;denominator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we get &lt;code&gt;9.0061113088164994e-584&lt;/code&gt; which, in real human speak, is .9 with 584 zeroes between the decimal point and the 9... that is, significantly less likely than picking a particular atom in randomly sampling from every atom in the known universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if I'm sampling Americans, it's vanishingly unlikely that that I get a sample with 100 members of Congress. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Draw100Congress|Draw100Americans)\)&lt;/span&gt; is that tiny number up above.  But it obviously does not follow that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Draw100Americans|Draw100Congress)\)&lt;/span&gt; is small. Indeed that second probability statement is 1, or damn close to it (even though the Constitution requires members of Congress be citizens, you might imagine some incredibly unlikely event like someone getting elected to Congress after successfully deceiving the public about his/her citizenship status). In other words, I &lt;em&gt;absolutely cannot&lt;/em&gt; infer from the unlikelihood of getting all members of Congress in my sample of Americans that it is unlikely that I had sampled Americans, given that I saw all members of Congress (Incidentally, I adapted this example from Cohen, 1994, &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0003-066X.49.12.997"&gt;The Earth is Round (p&amp;lt;.05)&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn adapted it from Pollard &amp;amp; Richardson, 1987, &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-30223-001"&gt;"On the Probability of Making Type I Errors"&lt;/a&gt;.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why this matters. In reality, many, many studies with a "statistically significant" p-value are likely to nonetheless be Type I errors. The reason is because the actual probability of a Type I error depends on the prior likelihood that the null hypothesis was false in the first place, as well as on how likely it is that you'd see your data (in other words, on the base rate). Let’s flesh this out some more with Bayes Rule. Remember it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As applied here, plugging in our concepts from above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(TypeIError) \frac{PValue \cdot P(NullHypothesis)}{P(DataSeen)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean?  Well, first of all, it means that in order to even take a wild guess at how likely it is that we’re making a Type I error, we have to know how likely our null hypothesis is (in Bayesian terms, we have to have a prior probability in our heads about it). If we have strong prior reason to believe our null hypothesis--if our alternative hypothesis, or the research finding we’re trying to test out, is really crazy, then we ought to conclude that it’s more likely that we’re making a Type I error, even in the face of a statistically significant p-value. For example, if you think you’ve provided evidence for psychic abilities, as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2016/oct/31/did-a-memory-experiment-really-show-evidence-for-psychic-abilities"&gt;occasionally shows up in psychology journals&lt;/a&gt;, you should probably estimate your probability of making a Type I error as quite high, because your prior on Dr. Xavier running around somewhere controlling stuff &lt;em&gt;with his miiiiiind&lt;/em&gt; is pretty small (or at least oughta be).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, you’d need to have some idea of the base rate of the data you observed in your sample (the denominator above). If it’s low, then that makes it more likely that we’re making a Type I error. Recall from our probability lesson that we can calculate that via the &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability"&gt;law of total probability&lt;/a&gt; as follows: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(DataSeen) = P(DataSeen|NullHypothesis) \cdot P(NullHypothesis) + \\P(DataSeen|AlternativeHypothesis) \cdot P(AlternativeHypothesis)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can that value be low? Well, one important way is that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(DataSeen|AlternativeHypothesis)\)&lt;/span&gt; could be low. In other words: sure, it might be that it’s really unlikely that you’d see the data you saw if your null hypothesis were true. But what if it’s &lt;em&gt;even more unlikely&lt;/em&gt; that you’d see the data you saw if your alternative hypothesis were true?! A low p-value means that the data you saw would come up pretty rarely in that null distribution.  But what if it would come up even more rarely in every other plausible distribution? This is the lesson of our Congress example: &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Draw100Congress|Draw100Foreigners)\)&lt;/span&gt; is much smaller even than the tiny number we got for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Draw100Congress|Draw100Americans)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this suggests is that the construction of the hypotheses really matter. Let's return to the Congress example. Suppose my null hypothesis was "this sample was constructed from the general population of Americans," and the alternative hypothesis was "this sample was constructed from the population of people found in the U.S. Capitol on the day of the State of the Union Address." Well, now, it seems like maybe the composition of our sample tells us something useful.  Because &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(Draw100Congress|Draw100FromCapitol)\)&lt;/span&gt; is probably pretty big, relatively speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what this all comes down to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often we don’t really know these other terms that go into the Bayes Rule equation to go from p-values to probabilities of Type I errors. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, prior theories of how the world works (like psychic powers not being real) can give us broad guesses for those other terms, which can give us a rough idea of how confident we should be in our results. This is part of why statistics folks look down on the practice of "data-mining," a.k.a., hunting through data without a theory looking for significant results. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only way to be really confident that empirical results are real is by replicating them--by getting significant results again and again from different samples. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t trust that a result is real just because it has a statistically significant p-value!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If some expert witness shows you a p-value of 0.05 and says "there's a 95% chance the null is false," you should laugh derisively at them and then fire them if they're your expert or cross examine them into oblivion if they're someone else's.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;F. Perry Wilson &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/Blogs/TheMethodsMan/52171"&gt;The P-Value is a Hoax, But Here's How to Fix it&lt;/a&gt;---This is an amazing concrete illustration with actual numbers of the point above about base rates.  Actually, you know what?  That's so good I'm going to quote it at length: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that there are 100,000 hypotheses out there -- floating in the ether. Some of the hypotheses are true, some are false (this is how science works, right?). It turns out that it's the proportion of true hypotheses that dictates how much of the medical literature is nonsense, not the p-value. Let me prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say that of our 100,000 hypotheses, 10%, or 10,000 are true. I may be a bit of a pessimist but I think I'm being pretty generous here. OK -- how many false positives will there be? Well, of the 90,000 false hypotheses, 5% (there's the p-value!) will end up appearing true in the study by chance alone. Five percent of 90,000 is 4,500 false positive studies. How many true positives will there be? Well, we have 10,000 true hypotheses -- but not all the studies will be positive. The number of positive studies will depend on how adequately "powered" they are, and power is usually set at around 80%, meaning that 8,000 of those true hypotheses will be discovered to be true when tested, while 2,000 will be missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So of our 100,000 hypotheses, we have a total of 12,500 positive studies. 4,500 of those 12,500 are false positives. That's 36%. [...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. Despite the comforting nature of the 0.05 threshold for the p-value, 36% of the positive studies you read may be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends critically on the number of true hypotheses by the way. If I drop the number of true hypotheses to 5%, keeping everything else the same, then 55% of the positive studies you read are wrong. It's a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(n.b.: we'll talk about the "power" thing later on in the class.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992-11-24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MANION, Circuit Judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States sued Joseph Balistrieri, owner of the Shorecrest Apartments in Milwaukee, and Angelina Hurdelbrink, his rental agent, alleging that Balistrieri and Hurdelbrink committed discriminatory rental practices in violation of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-19. A jury found for the government and awarded damages to several aggrieved individuals and to a Milwaukee fair housing organization, the Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council (MMFHC). The district court subsequently imposed an injunction on Balistrieri and imposed civil penalties on him and Hurdelbrink. Balistrieri and Hur-delbrink appeal, raising a plethora of issues regarding liability, damages, and the propriety of injunctive relief; the government cross-appeals the district court’s decisions not to allow it to seek damages for two other people and to remove the issue of punitive damages from the jury. We affirm in part and reverse in part,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Testing” is a method used by organizations such as the MMFHC to ferret out discriminatory housing practices. In conducting a test, the MMFHC sends two people posing as customers, one white and one black, to a realtor, home, or apartment complex. The two people would be as close to identical in distinguishing characteristics other than race — for example, age and marital status — as possible. The two would inquire about the identical type of housing. Differences in response to the two testers — for example, quoting higher prices to a black, or giving the two testers different stories about the availability of an apartment — could indicate discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MMFHC decided to perform a test at the Shorecrest Apartments. The test was not prompted by any complaints about discrimination but rather was intended to provide a new tester the opportunity to conduct a test. Carla Herbig, the new tester, who is black, went to the Shorecrest at about 5:30 p.m. on April 25, 1989, and met with Hurdelbrink. After Herbig told Hur-delbrink she was interested in a one-bedroom apartment for May or June, Hurdel-brink showed her apartment 321 and told her the rent was $500 per month. Hurdel-brink did not show Herbig any other facilities in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Kate Lonsdorf, who is white, visited the Shorecrest. Like Herbig, Lonsdorf told Hurdelbrink she was interested in a one-bedroom apartment for May or June. Hurdelbrink showed Lonsdorf the same apartment she showed Herbig, but told her the rent was $480 per month. Hurdelbrink also showed Lonsdorf the building’s storage and laundry facilities and told Lonsdorf about the building’s restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the results of this test, Carla Wertheim, MMFHC’s. associate director, suspected discrimination and decided that more tests would be appropriate. Thus, on April 29, Kim Davis, who is black, visited the Shorecrest and told Hurdelbrink she wanted a two-bedroom apartment. Hurdelbrink responded that no two-bedroom apartments were available. However, Hurdelbrink did show Davis a three-bedroom apartment and told her the rent was $850 per month. Hurdelbrink also told Davis that she might have some two-bedroom apartments after June, for which the rent would be $850 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one hour after Davis left, Lynn Connolly, a white tester, arrived at the Shorecrest. Connolly, like Davis, told Hur-delbrink that she was looking for a two-bedroom apartment. Hurdelbrink told Connolly that no two-bedroom apartments were currently available. However, Hur-delbrink did show Connolly an office that was to be converted into a two-bedroom apartment that would be available June 1 for $700 per month. Hurdelbrink also showed Connolly a vacant three-bedroom apartment and told Connolly that the apartment could be converted to a two-bedroom apartment which would rent for $875 per month. When Connolly asked about an application, Hurdelbrink gave her one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 5, Carol Cunningham, who is white, met with Hurdelbrink at the Shore-crest and told Hurdelbrink she was interested in a one- or two-bedroom unit. Hur-delbrink showed Cunningham a two-bedroom unit on the eighth floor with a quoted rent of $850 per month, a one-bedroom apartment on the second floor with a quoted rent of $475 per month, and a one-bedroom apartment (with no rent quoted) on the third floor, apartment 321. Hurdel-brink also told Cunningham that two other one-bedroom apartments were available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, Sheryl Sims-Daniels, who is black, visited the Shorecrest. She told Hurdelbrink she was interested in one- and two-bedroom apartments. Hurdelbrink showed Sims-Daniels apartment 801, a two-bedroom, and told her the rent was $875 per month. Hurdelbrink also showed her apartment 321 and told her the rent was $525 per month. Hurdelbrink did not show Sims-Daniels any other apartments. When Sims-Daniels asked to fill out an application, Hurdelbrink told her she could not because of uncertainty about any apartments being available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MMFHC conducted two more tests. For the fourth test, Barry Zalben, who is white, met with Hurdelbrink at the Shorecrest on May 11, 1989, and asked about one- and two-bedroom apartments. Hurdelbrink showed him apartment 801, a two-bedroom apartment, and told him the rent was $875 per month. Hurdelbrink also showed Zal-ben two one-bedroom apartments; apartment 615, for which she told him the rent was $500 per month, and apartment 308, for which she told him the rent was $475 per month. Hurdelbrink told Zalben that all three apartments would be available sometime between June 1 and June 4. Hurdelbrink called Zalben on May 17, but he did not return her call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Thompson, who is black, spoke with Hurdelbrink at the Shorecrest about one hour after Zalben. Thompson asked to see one- and two-bedroom apartments and told Hurdelbrink that he would like to move in as soon as possible. Hurdelbrink only showed Thompson apartment 615 and told him the monthly rent was $525. Hurdel-brink brought him up to apartment 801 but did not take him inside; she told him the rent was $875 per month. Hurdelbrink told Thompson that both apartments would be available in July. But a white man named Walter Cain (who was not a tester) ended up renting apartment 615 on May 20, paying $500 per month rent. Thompson asked to fill out an application, but Hurdel-brink told him he could not do so until he put down a deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the final test, Carl Hubbard, who is black, met Hurdelbrink at the Shorecrest on June 5. Hubbard asked to see one- and two-bedroom apartments; Hurdelbrink, claiming that she could not show him any two-bedroom apartments, showed him only one one-bedroom apartment. She told Thompson the rent for that apartment was $525 per month. She did not say when the apartment would be available, told Thompson his name could be placed on a waiting list, and told him also that he could fill out an application only when he was ready to rent. Hurdelbrink asked Hubbard several times about his “creditworthiness” although Hubbard assured her that his credit was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Valent, a white tester, met with Hur-delbrink at the Shorecrest about two hours after Hubbard. Valent told Hurdelbrink that he was interested in one- and two-bedroom apartments, and Hurdelbrink showed him apartment 204, which she told him would be available on June 15 for a rent of $475 per month. She had previously told him over the phone about two other two-bedroom apartments that would become available later. At the Shorecrest, Hurdelbrink told Valent that he could move into a one-bedroom apartment and then move into a two-bedroom apartment when one became available. When Valent asked for an application, Hurdelbrink gave him one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides,the testers, two other witnesses testified about their experiences attempting to rent at the Shorecrest during the spring of 1989. Marva Pattillo, who is black, met with Hurdelbrink at the Shore-crest on May 6 and asked about a two-bedroom apartment. Hurdelbrink showed Pattillo an eighth-floor apartment with a lake view. Pattillo told Hurdelbrink she loved the apartment and was “definitely interested” in it, and asked Hurdelbrink what the rent was. Hurdelbrink said she did not know the rent offhand but would find out. Hurdelbrink called Pattillo several days later and told her the rent was $850 per month. When Pattillo returned to the Shorecrest on May 13 to see the apartment again, she told Hurdelbrink that she liked it and would-need only a day or two to make her plans final. On May 15, Pattillo called Hurdelbrink to say that she would take the apartment. Hurdelbrink was not in, so Pattillo left a message. Over the next week to ten days, Pattillo called Hurdelbrink often at both the Shorecrest and at home, and left numerous messages at the Shorecrest. But Pattillo’s effort was in vain; when she finally reached Hurdelbrink, Hurdelbrink told her the apartment had been rented. Hurdelbrink did show Pattillo another available apartment. But that apartment was smaller, in a state of some disrepair, and did not have as good a view. Pattillo eventually moved into an apartment in another building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maureen Wahl, who is white, was also looking for an apartment at about the same time Pattillo was. Wahl first, visited the Shorecrest in mid-April. Hurdelbrink showed her some apartments, but she did not like what she saw. Wahl left Hurdelbrink her card and told Hurdelbrink to call when something else became available. Hurdelbrink called about a week later to say a larger apartment was available. Wahl met Hurdelbrink at the Shorecrest during the first week of May and looked at apartment 801, a large apartment with a “spectacular” (in Wahl’s words) view of Lake Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wahl liked the apartment immediately. She told Hurdelbrink she would take it, but did not fill out an application or leave a deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurdelbrink called Wahl about two weeks later to tell Wahl that other people were interested in apartment 801, and to ask Wahl if she was sure she wanted the apartment. Wahl said she did want the apartment. Sometime later, she followed up those words by mailing a check for July rent to Hurdelbrink. The record does not say exactly when Wahl sent the check; however, the check was dated May 29, so it is fair to infer that Wahl sent it near that date, which was after Hurdelbrink had told Pattillo the apartment had been rented. Wahl did not fill out an application or credit check form although the defendants testified that a completed application and successful credit check were part of their standard operating procedure before renting an apartment. Wahl did not sign a lease until August and did not move into the apartment until September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury found that Hurdelbrink and Bal-istrieri had violated the Fair Housing Act by intentionally engaging in a pattern or practice of discrimination. Although none of the testers suffered any monetary loss, the jury awarded each tester $2,000 as compensation for the emotional distress they said they suffered upon finding out they had been discriminated against. The jury also awarded $5,000 to the MMFHC. The jury awarded no damages to Pattillo because the court had ruled before trial that the government could not seek damages for Pattillo or Kim Williams, another black person against whom the government alleged the defendants had discriminated. In fact, the court barred the government from presenting any evidence regarding Williams at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a post-trial hearing before the court, the court enjoined Balistrieri from further discriminatory rental practices and ordered him to prepare a plan to establish nondiscriminatory rental procedures and ensure that all Shorecrest employees understood their obligations under the Fair Housing Act. The court did not enter an injunction against Hurdelbrink because by the time of the hearing she had resigned her position at the Shorecrest. The court did, however, impose civil penalties of $100 against Hurdelbrink and $2,500 against Balistrieri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Housing Act prohibits various forms of discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. Specifically, 42 U.S.C. § 3604 makes it unlawful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because of race....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(b) To discriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) To represent to any person because of race ... that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having determined that, we move on to the defendants’ next argument, which is that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s finding that they engaged in a pattern or practice of Housing Act violations. They first argue that because none of the testers were actually seeking apartments, there was no Fair Housing Act violation. That is incorrect. In Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982), the Supreme Court held that falsely informing testers that apartments are unavailable violates § 3604(d), which makes it illegal to misinform “any person” about the availability of housing. Id. at 373, 102 S.Ct. at 1121; see also Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521, 1526 (7th Cir.1990). Unlike § 3604(a), § 3604(d) does not require a bona fide offer; instead, § 3604(d) creates an enforceable right to truthful information for any person, not just bona fide apartment seekers. Havens, 455 U.S. at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121. This logic also extends to § 3604(b), which prohibits discrimination against “any person” in the terms or conditions of rentals and, like § 3604(d), does not require a bona fide offer. Therefore, offering black testers apartments at higher rental rates than those offered to white testers discriminates in the terms of rentals and violates the Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants also argue that even if the Act did not require that the testers be bona fide applicants, the evidence was insufficient to show that they treated the black testers less favorably than the white testers. We disagree. Five sets of testers testified in this case. In each test, the black person was treated less favorably: he or she was either shown fewer apartments, quoted higher rents, or quoted later dates of availability; in some cases, all those occurred on the same test. Moreover, based on the testimony of Pattillo and Wahl, the jury could reasonably infer that Hurdelbrink made special efforts to rent to Wahl, a white person — going so far as to dispense with the usual requirements of a completed application and a credit check — to avoid renting to Pattillo, who was black. Thus the evidence showed that (at least in those cases) Hurdelbrink consistently treated the black apartment seekers somewhat less favorably than the white apartment seekers. Based on this evidence, the jury could conclude Hurdel-brink’s treatment of the black testers violated the Fair Housing Act’s prohibitions against racial discrimination in the terms or conditions for housing rental and against racially-motivated misrepresentations about housing availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government, however, had to prove more than the fact that the defendants discriminated against several people. Section 3614(a) empowers the Attorney General to sue if he has cause to believe that a “pattern or practice” of violations exists. Proof of isolated or sporadic acts of discrimination does not suffice to prove a pattern or practice. Rather, the government must present evidence from which the fact-finder can reasonably conclude “ ‘that ... discrimination was the [defendants’] standard operating procedure — the regular rather than the unusual practice.’ ” King v. General Electric Co., 960 F.2d 617, 623 (7th Cir.1992); United States v. DiMucci, 879 F.2d 1488, 1497 n. 11 (7th Cir.1989) (both quoting International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 1855, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was the evidence here sufficient for the jury to conclude reasonably that discrimination was the defendants’ “regular practice”? Based on similar evidence, we upheld a finding of a pattern of discrimination in DiMucci. In that case, the government proved six incidents in which black apartment seekers or testers were treated less favorably than their white counterparts. See 879 F.2d at 1492 &amp;amp; nn. 6-7. We held this showing was sufficient to establish a pattern or practice, commenting that “courts have granted relief based on fewer incidents than these.” Id. at 1499 (citing United States v. Pelzer Realty Co., 484 F.2d 438 (5th Cir.1973)). As in DiMucci, the government here has shown that over a relatively brief period (a little more than a month) five black testers and Marva Pattil-lo visited the Shorecrest. In each case, the blacks were treated less favorably than their white counterparts, all being offered less favorable terms and, except in one instance, being shown fewer apartments. As in DiMucci, a jury could reasonably infer that this was more than “isolated or ‘accidental’ or sporadic.” Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 336, 97 S.Ct. at 1855.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King, which was decided after this case was briefed, could be read to indicate that the evidence here was not sufficient to support a finding of a pattern of discrimination. In King, we held that evidence of age discrimination against eleven employees at a GE plant in 1983 and 1984, and six employees in 1985, was not sufficient to show that a pattern of discrimination existed at GE during those periods. See 960 F.2d at 619, 626-627. However, a finding of pattern is a factual finding, and each case must stand on its own facts. Eleven instances of discrimination over two years, or six over one year at a large factory may very well be sporadic; but a jury may reasonably infer that when a defendant who in six chances over the course of little more than a month consistently discriminates, the discrimination is more than a sporadic occurrence. Moreover, King did not cite DiMucci, much less purport to overrule it. DiMucci, which is therefore still good law, requires the conclusion that the evidence in this case was sufficient to support a finding of a pattern of discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[n. 1] Although Pattillo did not remember the number of the eighth-floor apartment she viewed, the government states that it was apartment 801. The defendants do not argue that Pattillo and Wahl did not view the same apartment, and the description of what Pattillo and Wahl saw— a large apartment on the eighth floor with a very good view of the lake — supports the inference that both viewed the same apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\newpage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;United States v. Garden Homes Management, Corp., 156 F. Supp. 2d 413&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2001-08-10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPINION &amp;amp; ORDER&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIFLAND, District Judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants Garden Homes Management Corp., Westbound Homes, Inc., Redstone Garden Apartments, Inc., Joseph Wilf and Cathy Rosenstein move for summary judgment dismissing this housing discrimination action. They argue that summary judgment is appropriate because plaintiff, the United States of America (“the Government”), has not presented sufficient, proof to establish that they engaged in a “pattern or practice” of discriminatory conduct. The Government disagrees and submits that the results of its fair housing tests, coupled with substantial independent evidence, show that defendants discriminated against prospective tenants on the basis of race and familial status. Defendant Wilf also seeks summary judgment. He contends that he cannot be held liable for the alleged misconduct of his rental agent. Once again, the Government disagrees. For the following reasons, Defendants’ motion is denied in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I. BACKGROUND&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. The Parties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This housing discrimination action involves three apartment complexes located in Parsippany, New Jersey: Lakeview Garden Apartments, Redstone Garden Apartments and Westgate Garden Apartments (collectively “the Subject Properties”). (Final Pretrial Order at § 3, p. 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first complex, Lakeview Garden Apartments, is a 214-unit property that contains two bedroom apartments. (Id.) JHW Associates, a partnership, owns the Lakeview complex. Defendant Wilf is a partner at JHW Associates. (Id. at p. 6.) The second, Redstone Garden Apartments, comprises 92 units, some of which are two bedrooms. (Id. at p. 5.) Defendant Redstone Garden Apartments, Inc. owns the Redstone complex. (Id.) The final complex, Westgate Garden Apartments, has 152 units. Like the others, it offers two bedroom apartments. (Id.) Defendant Westbound Homes, Inc. owns the Westgate property. Defendant Wilf is an officer of Westbound Homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Garden Homes Management Corp. manages the Lakeview, Redstone, and Westgate complexes. (Id. at p. 6.) It is responsible for establishing rental policies, supervising staff, maintaining vacancy information, evaluating rental applications, and keeping tenant files for each property. (Id.) During 1998, Defendant Wilf served as an officer of Garden Homes. (Id.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Rosenstein, an employee of JHW Associates, serves as the rental agent for the Subject Properties. (Id. at p. 5.) In this capacity, she disseminates vacancy information and shows apartments to interested parties; provides rental applications and information about how to complete them; and verifies answers that applicants furnish. (Id.) The Subject Properties have one rental office, which is located at the Lakeview complex. (Id.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. The Fair Housing Tests&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 1998, the United States Department of Justice, in tandem with the Northern New Jersey Fair Housing Council, began investigating the Subject Properties. The inquiry spanned one month and consisted of three fair housing tests. (Id. at p. 6.) These tests, along with subsequent investigation, allegedly revealed racial discrimination as well as discrimination against applicants with small children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the tests occurred in roughly the same way. (Defendants’ Statement of Material Facts at 24.) On each occasion, an African-American tester inquired about the availability of a two bedroom apartment at the Subject Properties, only to be informed that such units were not available. Within twenty-four hours, a white tester arrived and made the same inquiry. The white tester was told that a two bedroom apartment was available-or would likely become available—and was encouraged to apply. The specific details of each test are as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The April 1998 Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 8, 1998, an African-American female tester went to the rental office and asked whether any two bedroom units were available. Defendant Rosenstein replied that “I hate to tell you. The two bedrooms are at a premium. At a premium. I must have 20 people ahead of the line.” (Decl. of Eric I. Halperin at Ex. A, p. 2. ln. 13-15.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She further explained that “two bedrooms are very hard in Parsippa-ny. That’s my only problem. I have none at this time.” (Id. p. 4, ln. 7-9.) She agreed to place the tester on a waiting list, but cautioned that “if you had little children, we would have to only consider you for the first floor.” (Id. at p. 3, ln. 8-10.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A white tester visited the rental office the next morning. She also met with Defendant Rosenstein, who informed her that “the only thing I have, to be very honest with you, is a 2 bedroom here and they’re very hard to come by.” (Id. at Ex. B., p. 3, ln. 4-6.) Defendant Rosenstein then engaged in sales talk to persuade the tester to take the apartment. (See, e.g., id. at p. 4, ln. 8-11.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The May 6, 1998 Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 6, 1998, an African-American female tester visited the rental office. She inquired about two-bedroom units for June 1, 1998. Defendant Rosenstein announced that “right now two bedrooms are at a premium ... I don’t think there’s one complex here in Parsippany that has a two bedroom. That’s how bad it is.” (Id. at Ex. C. p. 2, ln.11-16.) Defendant Rosenstein promised to put the tester on a waiting list, but warned her that the list had at least twenty names on it already. (Id. at p. 2, In. 18-24.) The tester then asked for a rental application, but Defendant Rosen-stein refused to provide one, declaring that it was not her policy to distribute applications. (Id. at. p. 11, In. 1-7.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several hours later, a white tester went to the rental office and asked about a two bedroom for June 1, 1998. Defendant Ro-senstein said that she would probably have a unit available for that date and, if not, that one would be vacant for June 15. (Id. at Ex. D., p. 3, In. 1-7; p. 9, In. 12-22; p. 10, In. 5-7.) She then showed the tester the apartment--which was the same unit offered to the white tester involved in the April 1998 test~and gave the tester a rental application. (Id. at. p. 18, In. 5-9.) In addition, Defendant Rosenstein questioned the tester closely about her family composition to verify that the tester did not have children. (Id. at p. 1, In. 15-19.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The May 8, 1998 Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s final test occurred on May 8, 1998. On that date, an African-American male tester went to the rental office and asked for a two bedroom apartment. Defendant Rosenstein immediately retorted that “you are going to have one heck of a time ... It’s impossible for a two bedroom. Impossible. They’re very, very, very hard to come by. I hate to tell you. I can take yoür name, but I have to tell you there’s a long list.” (Id. at Ex. E, p. 2, In. 12 18.) She then directed him to other apartment complexes in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A white tester arrived at the rental office less than two hours later. He asked for a two bedroom apartment in mid-June, but was told that it would be difficult to find a vacancy. (Id. at Ex. F, p. 2, In. 14-22.) Defendant Rosenstein then showed the tester an apartment that might be available for that date-the same apartment that she showed to each of the prior white testers-but informed him that two other individuals were interested and that they had priority. (See, e.g., id. at p. 12, In. 18-20.) She suggested that the tester could have the apartment if the other individuals did not take it and told him what he needed to do to obtain a lease. (Id. at p. 6, In. 9-13.) Defendant Rosenstein also gave the tester a rental application. (Id. at In. 19-21.) On May 13, 1998, Defendant Rosen-stein called the tester to find out if he was still interested in the apartment. (Id. at Ex. G, p. 2, In. 17-24.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. The Government’s Subsequent Investigation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government developed evidence in addition to the results of its fair housing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation identified Steven Jackson as a racial discrimination victim. Mr. Jackson, an African-American, avers that he went to the rental office in early January 1999 seeking a two-bedroom. (Id. at Ex. H,  3.) Defendant Rosenstein allegedly told him that she did not have anything available. (Id. at  4.) However, after receiving notice of the Government’s intention to file this suit, (Id. at Ex. K), Defendant Rosenstein contacted Mr. Jackson and offered him an apartment, (Id. at Ex. H,  6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Mr. Jackson, the Government located Patricia Dacres, an African American mother of one. (Id. at Ex. I,  2-4.) Ms. Dacres declares that she went to the rental office in April 1999 looking for a two bedroom for herself, her husband, and her infant son. (Id.) She walked through an available second floor apartment and subsequently obtained, an application. After she disclosed that she had a young child, Defendant Rosenstein tried to dissuade her from taking the unit. (Id. at  8-9.) Ms. Dacres then left the rental office and completed the application. She returned several days later, at which time Defendant Rosenstein “attempted to discourage [her] from renting the second floor apartment that [she] was applying for. [Defendant Rosenstein] stated, that children should be on the first floor. [Defendant Rosenstein] said, in fact it’s illegal to rent to children on the second floor and that she had no first floor apartment available.” (Id. at  10.) Garden Homes ultimately denied Ms. Dacres’ tenancy application. (Id. at  14.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government also identified witnesses who will testify that Defendants adhered to a policy of discrimination against families with small children. For example, Rodney Lynch, a current first-floor resident of the Lakeview complex, asserts that Defendant Rosenstein told him that he could not rent a second-floor unit because he had children. (Id. at Ex. S,  7.) Jacquelyn Footman, a former first-floor Lakeview tenant, allegedly experienced similar treatment. (Id. at Ex. U,  5.) Finally, and most significantly, Defendant Rosenstein herself expressed a preference for keeping families with small children off the upper floors of the Subject Properties. During her deposition she testified that she followed this policy and that her supervisor knew as much. (Id. at Ex. J, p. 122, In. 17 to p. 123, In. 22.) However, she reiterated that her policy was not ironclad and that she never refused to rent apartments because of the presence of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D. Procedural History&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on its fair housing tests and subsequent investigation, the Government filed suit on June 21, 1999. It accuses Defendants of violating the Fair Housing Act by committing racial and familial status discrimination. It seeks a combination of legal and equitable relief to remedy these alleged wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants submit that the record contains insufficient evidence that they followed a pattern or practice of discrimination on any basis. Because the establishment of a pattern or practice is a predicate for liability under the Fan-Housing Act, they argue that the Government cannot prevail as a matter of law. Accordingly, Defendants move for summary judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Wilf also pursues summary judgment. He contends that he cannot be held accountable for the illicit acts of his rental agent and that dismissal is warranted as to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;III. DISCUSSION&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Pattern or Practice of Discrimination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fair Housing Act prohibits various forms of discrimination in the rental housing market. Specifically, the Act makes it unlawful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(a) To refuse to sell or rent after the making of a bona fide offer, or to refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any person because or race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(d) To represent to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin that any dwelling is. not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 U.S.C. § 3604(a)-(d). The Act also empowers the Government to enforce these bans. It does not confer unlimited authority however. Rather, the Government may bring a civil action against “any person or group of persons ... engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the rights granted by this [Act] ...” 42 U.S.C. § 3614(a). The existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination is a predicate to the Government’s ability to maintain a Fair Housing Act suit. See United States v. Bob Lawrence Realty, Inc., 474 F.2d 115, 122-23 (5th Cir.1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 826, 94 S.Ct. 131, 38 L.Ed.2d 59 (1973) (noting that the Government has standing to sue when a pattern or practice exists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish a pattern or practice, the Government must do more than submit proof of discrimination. It must show “by a preponderance of the evidence that ... discrimination was the company’s standard operating procedure... the regular rather than the unusual practice.” Int’l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 336, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). Isolated, accidental, or sporadic instances of discrimination are insufficient. Id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Defendants’ misconduct must be more than isolated to rise to the level of an actionable pattern or practice, there is no threshold number of incidents that must occur before the Government may initiate litigation. See Bob Lawrence Realty, 474 F.2d at 123-24. Indeed, “ ‘the number of [violations] ... is not determinative ... no mathematical formula is workable, nor was any intended. Each case must turn on its own facts.’ ” Id. at 124 (quoting United States v. West Peachtree Tenth Corp., 437 F.2d 221, 227 (5th Cir.1971)). Whether the evidence presented demonstrates a pattern or practice is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury. See United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 930 (7th Cir.1992).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pattern or Practice of Racial Discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury viewing the record could reasonably conclude that Defendants routinely discriminated. In Balistrieri, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury’s determination that the defendants engaged in a pattern of discrimination. The evidence in that case is strikingly similar to the evidence now before the Court. There, a local housing organization tested the defendants’ apartment building five times in just over one month. During the tests, black and white testers asked to see one or two bedroom apartments. They received different responses based on their race. Their testimony showed that the building’s rental agent (1) quoted black testers higher rents than their white counterparts; (2) neglected to show black testers available apartments but took white testers on complete tours; and (3) provided rental applications to white testers while refusing to give them to black testers. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 924-25, 929. In addition, two non-tester witnesses came forward and testified. The first, a black individual, recounted the trouble she had trying to rent from defendants. The second, a white individual, testified about how defendants facilitated her application. Id. at 925-26. The Seventh Circuit agreed that these incidents established a pattern. The Court was particularly impressed with the chronology of events, stating that “a jury may reasonably infer that when a defendant who in six chances over the course of little more than a month consistently discriminates, the discrimination is more than a sporadic occurrence.” Id. at 930.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Balistrieri, the investigation in this case occurred over a relatively brief period. In the span of one month, the Government tested the Subject Properties three times. Defendant Rosenstein treated black testers differently than white testers on each occasion. She told black testers that two bedroom units were unavailable, when it appears that at least one such unit was vacant. Within hours after each black tester departed, she informed a white tester that a two bedroom was available or would likely become so. In addition, Defendant Rosenstein encouraged white testers and showed them vacant apartments. In one instance, she even followed up to verify a white tester’s interest. In marked contrast, she generally discouraged black testers, suggested that two bedroom units were impossible to locate, and instructed them to put their names on a fictitious waiting list if they desired to pursue a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendant Rosenstein also refused to supply rental applications to interested black testers, but gave applications to white testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Government’s evidence creates a genuine issue of fact for the jury. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930. While, in the abstract, three fair housing tests might not necessarily reflect Defendants’ rental practices, the tests at issue are particularly probative. They all occurred within one month and yielded virtually identical results. The timing and uniform results of these tests give rise to a permissible inference that racial discrimination is not a sporadic event but, instead, is part of the way that Defendants do business. Id. The statements of Ms. Dacres and Mr. Jackson, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, buttress this conclusion. Ms. Dacres, an African American, avers that Defendants denied her rental application and Mr. Jackson, who is also African American, relates that he secured an apartment only after the Government filed this suit. Their experiences, which occurred after the Government’s testing ended, arguably show that Defendants’ discriminatory practices are pervasive, not an aberration limited to a discrete period of time. Because these inferences and conclusions are permissible, there exists a genuine issue as to whether Defendants consistently discriminated. Therefore, summary judgment must be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants attempt to resist this outcome on several grounds. First, they argue that the Government has presented only three instances of misconduct. (Defendants’ Br. in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment at p. 15.) In their view, this is the “bare minimum” number of acts needed to establish a pattern or practice. (Id. at. p. 16.) Defendants are incorrect on both points. In addition to its three fair housing tests, the Government identified two additional witnesses — Ms. Dacres and Mr. Jackson — who will testify about Defendants’ rental practices. Thus, the record contains evidence of at least five incidents of racial discrimination. More importantly, Defendants’ focus on the number of incidents is misplaced. The Fair Housing Act does not obligate the Government to prove a minimum number of violations to establish a pattern or practice of discrimination. See Bob Lawrence Realty, 474 F.2d at 124; cf. DiMucci, 879 F.2d at 1499 (recognizing a pattern of discrimination where “defendants refused on occasion to rent to black bona fide apartment seekers, gave black and white testers differing information on the availability of apartments, and treated black testers significantly differently from white testers”) (emphasis supplied); United States v. Big D Enterpr., Inc., 184 F.3d 924, 931 (8th Cir.1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1018, 120 S.Ct. 1419, 146 L.Ed.2d 311 (2000) (finding that discrimination against three individuals was sufficient).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Defendants argue that a pattern or practice does not exist because tests at a fourth property revealed no discrimination. Defendant Garden Homes either owns or manages a Connecticut apartment complex known as Aspen Woods. Almost a year after it filed this suit, the Government began investigating Aspen Woods for national origin discrimination. Defendants contend that the Aspen Woods investigation resulted in a no-discrimination finding, which shows that discrimination does not pervade their business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the purported results of the Aspen Woods investigation are relevant and admissible, that evidence does not compel summary judgment for Defendants. Whether a pattern or practice exists is a question of fact for the jury. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930. At best, the Aspen Woods evidence contradicts the rest of the Government’s proofs and creates a factual dispute. The jury, not this Court, must resolve that dispute by evaluating the Aspen Woods evidence, determining whether it is credible, weighing it against all the evidence presented, and ultimately deciding if it defeats the Government’s case. Id.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, Defendants proffer statistics to counter the existence of a pattern or practice. These statistics purportedly show that the percentage of African Americans living in the Subject Properties exceeds the percentage of African Americans living in Morris County, New Jersey or Parsippa-ny, where the Subject Properties are located. These figures are not determinative for several reasons. The most glaring is that they are faulty. At least two of the individuals that Defendants counted as African Ameriean-for purposes of calculating the percentage of African American tenants-are in fact white. (Halperin Decl. at Ex. Q,  6-8.) This error skews Defendants’ calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while statistical proof is relevant in housing discrimination actions, it does not carry dispositive weight. See United States v. Housing Authority of the City of Chickasaw, 504 F.Supp. 716, 729 (S.D.Ala.1980). Defendants’ figures must be weighed along with all the other evidence presented to determine if a pattern or practice exists. The jury is responsible for conducting that weighing process. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the mere presence of black tenants at the Subject Properties does not preclude the Government from establishing a pattern or practice of racial discrimination. In an analogous context, the Third Circuit announced that “we need not find that [the defendant] always discriminated to find that it engaged in such a pattern or practice.” Lansdowne Swim Club, 894 F.2d at 89. This statement recognizes that a defendant might on occasion make exceptions to its discriminatory norm, but that such exceptions do not bar liability. The Third Circuit’s holding precludes summary judgment in this case. It is possible that Defendants took in a small number of African American tenants to disguise their discriminatory practices. Cf. Davis v. Mansards, 597 F.Supp. 334, 345 (N.D.Ind.1984) (finding a pattern even though defendants rented to blacks “in significant numbers,” because defendants sought “to control the complex’s black population by discouraging all negro applicants, allowing a few of the most promising apartment seekers to apply, and finally choosing to rent to those black applicants who pass some secret test unrelated to apartment availability”). Or Defendants may have adopted discriminatory practices to prevent the minority population from growing. Or, as Defendants now argue, the Subject Properties may house black tenants because Defendants do not routinely discriminate. Each of these explanations is plausible. It is the jury’s task to decide which one, if any, fits the facts of this case. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, there exists a genuine issue of fact as to whether Defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of violating 42 U.S.C. § 3604. Thus, summary judgment must be denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pattern or Practice of Familial Status Discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants challenge this conclusion for several reasons. Their primary argument is that the Subject Properties contain a high percentage of tenants with children, and that a large number of these families live in second floor residences. As previously noted, statistical evidence is not dispositive. See Chickasaw, 504 F.Supp. at 729. It must be weighed along with all the other proofs to determine whether a pattern exists. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930. Moreover, the mere fact that in the past Defendants rented second floor units to families with children does not preclude the jury from finding that Defendants now adhere to a contrary pattern or practice. See Lansdowne Swim Club, 894 F.2d at 89; Davis, 597 F.Supp. at 345.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defendants also question some of the Government’s evidence. Specifically, they maintain that Ms. Dacres’ rental application was denied for credit reasons, not because she is African American or has a small child. However, they submit no evidence to support this claim. Even if they had, their contention merely creates a factual dispute that must be resolved at trial. See Balistrieri, 981 F.2d at 930. Given the evidence supporting the Government’s case, a jury would be entitled to reject Defendants’ credit denial explanation. See United States v. Reddoch, 467 F.2d 897, 899 (5th Cir.1972) (affirming conclusion that credit check was employed as a ruse to cover up racially motivated denials). Moreover, a jury could accept Defendants’ credit denial justification and still find that Defendants discriminated against Ms. Da-cres because discrimination does not have to be the sole reason for Defendants’ conduct. See Selden v. United States Dep’t of Housing &amp;amp; Urban Development, 785 F.2d 152, 161 (6th Cir.1986). As long as the Government shows that “familial status was a motivating factor (though not necessarily the sole motivating factor) in the allegedly violative [denial],” Branella, 972 F.Supp. at 298 (emphasis original), then Ms. Dacres’ experience would support the existence of a pattern or practice. Therefore, Defendants’ credit denial argument does not require dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, Inc. v. Hotard, 275 F. Supp. 3d 776&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017-08-07&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SECTION “R” (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SARAH S. VANCE, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case arises from allegations of' housing discrimination at an apartment building located at 3839 Ulloa Street, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The building is owned and operated by Defendants Jim Hotard and 3839 Ulloa Street, LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, Inc., filed this lawsuit on April 23, 2015, asserting a claim under the Fair Housing Act (FHA), 42 U.S.C. § 3601, et seq. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs complaint alleged that defendant Hotard treated potential renters for his property differently on the basis of their race. More specifically, plaintiff alleges that Hotard refused to respond to email inquiries regarding his property from African-American testers but responded promptly to email inquiries from white testers. Further, plaintiff alleges that Hotard responded less favorably to phone inquiries from African-American testers than he did to phone inquiries from white testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 17, 2017, the Court held a bench trial. The Court has jurisdiction over plaintiffs FHA claim under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343(a)(3), and 42 U.S.C. § 3613. After hearing live testimony and reviewing all the evidence, the Court rules as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;II. FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center (GNOFHAC)-is a private section 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that works to end housing discrimination and segregation in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization focuses on four areas: enforcement (ie., bringing claims on behalf of individuals who have experienced housing discrimination), policy advocacy, education and outreach, and homeownership protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways that GNOFHAC identifies housing discrimination is through testing. Testing is an investigative tool commonly used by fair housing organizations to determine if landlords and others offering housing are discriminating or engaging in differential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOFHAC’s Investigations Coordinator Michelle Morgan testified that GNOFHAC gives paired testers “profiles” that include assigned' information on the tester’s income, education, work history, and other information relevant to housing. The testers are equally qualified for the housing, and similar in all relevant characteristics except for the characteristic subject to testing. For example, if testing for racial discrimination, the testers’ profiles will match except for race. The testers record their interactions with landlords through audio-recording devices, and also provide written reports of their encounters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOFHAC provides their testers with a training manual, in-class training exercises, and mock encounters. Morgan testified that the testers are not told in advance what they are testing for, as to not bias or compromise the test. The testers are compensated for their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. The Tests, and GNOFHAC’s Response&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan testified that in March of 2013, a Craigslist advertisement for two available units at Hotard’s Ulloa Street property came to her attention. Morgan was not sure how she came across the ad, and suggested that either a staff member referred it to her, or she came across it during her own search of new advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan testified that the ad stuck out to her because it said “no Section 8” on it, and Morgan believed this was coded language suggesting that the units were not available to African * Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the advertisement-solicited email responses, Morgan decided to conduct an email test. Morgan reached out to Jesse Chanin and Denise Frazier, two previous testers with multiple years of experience conducting tests for GNOFHAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse used the name “Jessy,” and Denise used the name “Trynesse,” which Morgan testified is an identifiably African-American name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, 2013, the testers sent similarly worded emails to Hotard, both indicating an interest in the apartment and requestr ing further information to set up a viewing. Hotard responded to Jessy with his phone number, but did not respond to Trynesse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the lack of response, Morgan decided to set up a second test to be conducted that same day. This time, instead of using actual testers, Morgan decided to create fake email addresses and email Hotard herself. Morgan used the names “Jahmal” and “Marzy,” and when asked why she used those names, Morgan asserted that Jahmal is “identifíably African American.” As with the first test, the emails sent to Hotard were similarly worded and both sought a time to view the apartment. Hotard responded to Marzy and offered to show her the apartment, but Hotard did not respond to Jahmal’s email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan then decided to set up a third email test. For the third test, conducted on March 13, 2013, Morgan used the names “Demaria” and “Elizabeth.” Morgan testified that she felt “Demaria” was “identifíably African American” and that “Elizabeth” was “neutral.” As with the first two tests, Hotard responded to Elizabeth’s email but did not respond to Demaria’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 26, 2013, Hotard placed another ad for the same units on Craigslist, but this ad requested phone inquiries instead of emails. Morgan testified that she wanted to continue testing, but because the advertisement changed to phone inquiries, Morgan switched to phone tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For her first phone test, Morgan reached out to Herschel Williams and Alex Owen, two testers with experience testing for GNOFHAC. Morgan gave Herschel and Alex their testing profiles, and a contact number to call Hotard. Herschel and Alex recorded their phone calls to Hotard, and the recordings were played for the Court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 27, 2013, Herschel called Hotard’s number listed on the ad. He reached Hotard’s voicemail, which listed another number to contact if interested in apartment vacancies. After leaving a voicemail, Herschel proceeded to call that second number, and left a voicemail there as well. While Herschel was on the phone, Hotard called him back, but did not leave a message. Herschel then tried Hotard again on both March 27 and 28, leaving multiple voicemails, and also texted him. Hotard never called Herschel back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on March 28, Alex called Hotard and left a voicemail. Hotard called Alex back shortly thereafter, and the two briefly discussed the apartment and set up a time for Alex to view the apartment on April 1. Alex viewed the apartment with Hotard on April 1, and on April 4, Hotard called Alex again to see if he was still interested in the apartment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan then set up the fifth and final test, to be conducted over April 4 and 5. Morgan picked Jahmal Clark and Matt Robinson for this test, two individuals with previous testing experience. On April 4, Jahmal called Hotard on both numbers and left messages on both. Shortly after, Hotard called Jahmal back, and the two discussed the unit and a possible visit. Jahmal asked if he could see the apartment on the following day (April 5), and Hotard told him he would be out of town. Hotard also said he was very busy that weekend, but that Monday would be a “great day.” Hotard told Jahmal to call back Monday morning to set up the viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That following day at 2:50 p.m., the same day Hotard told Jahmal he would be out of town, Matt called Hotard. Hotard answered, and when Matt asked to see the apartment, Hotard told him to come by that day at 3:30 p.m. Matt then met Hotard at the apartment building and viewed the unit. On that following Monday, Jahmal called Hotard back and left a voicemail, but Hotard never called Jahmal back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following this fifth test, Morgan felt that GNOFHAC had enough evidence to initiate a complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court finds Hotard’s testimony that he did not know the race of the testers that contacted him to be credible, especially because it is uncontested that he never saw any of the African-American testers. Plaintiff seeks a finding from the Court that Hotard knew the race of the African-American email testers based solely on their names, and knew the race of the phone testers based solely on their voices. But even assuming that awareness of a name and voice alone could establish one’s knowledge of another’s race, the Court finds that plaintiff has failed to show that Hotard knew the tester’s races based on their names and voices in this case. Plaintiff provides no expert testimony to support its contention, even though expert testimony is typically used to prove linguistic profiling or that race is identifiable by a person’s name. See, e.g., U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Target Corp., 460 F.3d 946, 961-62 (7th Cir. 2006) (noting that EEOC “presented expert testimony indicating that some people can determine a speaker’s race based on his or her voice or name”); United States v. Bostic, 713 F.2d 401, 404 (8th Cir. 1983) (noting that witness’s testimony that he identified defendant’s race based on defendant’s voice should be viewed with “circumspection” because the witness was not a linguistic expert); United States v. Housing Authority of City of Chickasaw, 504 F.Supp. 716, 725-26 (S.D. Ala. 1980) (finding study not reliable because no evidence established qualifications of pollsters to. identify race of person on the basis of person’s voice); see also Michael Erard, Language Matters, 5 J. L. &amp;amp; Soc. Challenges 225, 225 (2003) (discussing use of linguistic profiling expert testimony in housing discrimination cases); Dawn L. Smalls, Linguistic Profiling and the Law, 15 Stan. L. &amp;amp; Pol’y Rev. 579, 586-87 (2004) (same); Audrey J. Lee, Unconscious Bias Theory in Employment Discrimination Litigation, 40 Harv. C.R.C.L. L. Rev. 481, 493-500 (2005) (discussing role of expert testimony in discrimination cases based on implicit bias towards names and voices).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, other courts in similar discrimination cases have cast doubts on these evidentiary arguments. See Bafford v. Township Apartments Assocs., No. 06-657, 2007 WL 4247763, at *5 (M.D. Fla. Nov. 30, 2007) (stating that plaintiffs “speculation” that defendant’s real estate broker knew plaintiffs race based solely on their telephone conversations was “insufficient to impute knowledge of his race to” the real estate broker); see also Wharton v. Knefel, 562 F.2d 550, 552 n.9 (8th Cir. 1977) (noting that district court expressed that “there isn’t a way in the world that this Court at least could ascertain by his voice what his race was”); City of Chickasaw, 504 F.Supp. 716, 725-26 (S.D. Ala. 1980).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court also finds Hotard’s testimony that an individual’s name would not affect his decision to respond to an email or return a call to be credible. It is undisputed that the vast majority of Hotard’s units have been rented to African-Americans, and Hotard’s and Golson’s testimony make clear that Hotard has, in more than one instance, gone out of his way to accommodate potential African-American tenants and work with them to fill out the necessary paperwork so that they can move into his units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;. . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[note 107] Direct evidence as relevant here would be evidence “which, if believed, proves” that race was a motivating factor in Hotard’s decision "without inference or presumption.” See, e.g., Jones v. Robinson Property Group, L.P., 427 F.3d 987, 992 (5th Cir. 2005) (citations omitted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall how in the first Python lesson we looked at the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop and saw how it allows us to repeat instructions to the computer as many times as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step up from a loop is a function, which allows us to wrap up a series of commands into a single command on its own. Let's take a look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall how in the first Python lesson we looked at the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop and saw how it allows us to repeat instructions to the computer as many times as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step up from a loop is a function, which allows us to wrap up a series of commands into a single command on its own. Let's take a look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;plus_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That code gives us the basic form of a function. Let's break it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First is the &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; keyword, which just say that we're defining a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;following that is a space, and then the name of the function, in this case &lt;code&gt;plus_one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;immediately following that (no space) are names for the &lt;em&gt;parameters&lt;/em&gt; that the function accepts, separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses. This function takes just one parameters, named &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;following that is a colon signifying the beginning of a new &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt; --- we'll talk about the concept of scope later, but just think of it as a new block like in a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;following that is the &lt;em&gt;body&lt;/em&gt; of the function, indented as per usual. Each of the parameters to the function is available as a variable in the body.  This function just has one line in the body, and it adds 1 to whatever is assigned to &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;this function, and most functions, end with a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement: a statement that starts with the keyword &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; and then includes an expression that evaluates to some value. This is the value that, as the name suggests, the function returns. In this case, returns means that the function evaluates to it when it's executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take a look at what happens when we execute it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plus_one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;call&lt;/em&gt; a function by entering its name followed by parentheses containing values for the function's parameters---we call these values &lt;em&gt;arguments&lt;/em&gt;.  So here, we're calling the function &lt;code&gt;plus_one&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. That value gets passed into the body of the function attached to the name in the appropriate place in the list of parameters, so it gets assigned &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; in the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function then executed, and evaluates to its return statement, if any. Here, of course, that just means that it evaluates to the number 2, which is assigned to the variable and printed as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions don't need to have any parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cat_noise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;MEOW&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cat_noise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;MEOW
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also don't need to have a return statement. If they don't have a return statement, they return the special value &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to have a function with no return statement? Well, some functions can do things that don't require returning. For example, they might modify other values in memory (though that gets a little complicated and we'll talk about it later) or they might print something, make an internet request, delete a file, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally you pass arguments by position, i.e., the first argument is the first parameter in the function, and so forth, and so forth.  But you can also pass arguments by name, by putting the names in the call to the function and then an equals sign. If you do so, you don't have to do it in order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Scope"&gt;Scope&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Scope"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning about functions also requires understanding the really important concept of &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt;. Every variable exists in a scope, and isn't defined, or has a different definition, outside of that scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions create their own scope.  What that means is that a variable defined in a function, or passed into it as one of its arguments, doesn't exist outside that scope. Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;100
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can see here is that even though we assigned &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to name in the scope of the &lt;code&gt;plus_10&lt;/code&gt; function, that didn't touch the values of those variables assigned outside the function.  We got to use those values inside the function without clashing with the external names.  This is how scope works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a function can't find a variable in its own scope, it looks outside in its &lt;em&gt;enclosing scope&lt;/em&gt; for it.  Here's another example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[19]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;plus_100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[20]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plus_100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;150
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; wasn't defined in the body or the arguments of &lt;code&gt;plus_100&lt;/code&gt;, so it went out into the &lt;em&gt;global scope&lt;/em&gt; to find a value for it. Since we'd assigned &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; earlier, it was findable by the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's reassign it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[21]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[22]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;plus_100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[22]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;149&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we called &lt;code&gt;plus_100&lt;/code&gt; again, it had to go looking for &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; in the global scope again, and it found a different value!  So it used that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a good practical programming clue for you. It's a bad idea to rely too much on variables in global scope (called &lt;em&gt;global variables&lt;/em&gt;), because if you accidentally change their names, it can lead to surprising bugs, like a function that you meant to add 100 to things actually adding 99 to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if you actually want to change a global variable inside a function?  Well, you could use the &lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; declaration in the body of the function, before you refer to that variable, in order to do that.  But that's a bad idea, don't do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[23]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if you find outself tempted to try something like this, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# you usually should rethink your code.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;insist_on_plus_100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[24]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;99&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;insist_on_plus_100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;99
150
100
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have nested scope---scope within scope within scope.  The outermost scope is the global scope, and a reference to a variable will look within the its own scope, and then within the next outer scope, and the next, and so forth, until it gets to the global scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[25]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;global scope&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;innermost scope&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;middle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;middle scope&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;inner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;outer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;middle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you guess what calling &lt;code&gt;outer()&lt;/code&gt; will do?  Take a minute to figure it out, and then run this code yourself and see if you're right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's often useful in performing data analysis to transform some of your variables to fit a common scale; this is especially useful in exploratory data analysis, because these transformations often make it much easier to eyeball the relationship between variables. (Also, some statistical techniques require these transformations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short lesson, we'll introduce two common methods of transforming data---the &lt;em&gt;log transform&lt;/em&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;p&gt;It's often useful in performing data analysis to transform some of your variables to fit a common scale; this is especially useful in exploratory data analysis, because these transformations often make it much easier to eyeball the relationship between variables. (Also, some statistical techniques require these transformations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this short lesson, we'll introduce two common methods of transforming data---the &lt;em&gt;log transform&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;centering and scaling (a.k.a. standardizing)&lt;/em&gt;, and we'll look at examples of them through the data underlying part of my 2016 book, &lt;a href="http://rulelaw.net/"&gt;The Rule of Law in the Real World&lt;/a&gt; (shameless plug).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start by loading the data and taking a quick look at what it looks like, as well as setting up the libraries we'll need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this table, we can see that some variables appear to be on radically different scales. In particular, the variable RoLScore (which is a measure of the rule of law) looks like it range from 40-ish to 80-ish, just on this snippet of information, while GDP appears to range, well, that e+xx notation is exponential notation, so it involves numbers with like 10 zeroes after it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, this table might turn out ugly when I post it online, so let's just look at an abbreviated version of the table to see.  (Sorry, I still haven't figured out how to get the table layout working right.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they're both obviously a bit skewed, but the rule of law is much less skewed.  In fact, what we see in the GDP data is pretty common for most data involving money: there are way, way, way more points at the low end than at the higher end.  Lots of poor countries, very few super-rich countries like the U.S. This often calls for a logarithmic transformation to understand the relationship between the two data points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Log-Transformations"&gt;Log Transformations&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Log-Transformations"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not recall from high school math, taking a logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation. That is, the statement $2^3 = 8$ is equivalent to the statement $\log_2 8 = 3$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logarithms are a bit tough for human psychology to really have intuitions about, but one good way to think of them is that they are a way of turning differences across orders of magnitude to differences within a single magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, suppose we had the following data: &lt;code&gt;[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000]&lt;/code&gt;.  The range goes from one to ten million and the difference between the first and the last element is obviously huge.  But if we take the log base 10 of every element in there, we end up with much smaller differences and a much less curvy line representing our datapoints in a graph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's do that to our gdp to see if it helps us make an interpretable graph. (We'll have to use numpy log functions because they can apply to a series of data just as well as an individual point, so we'll just shadow (overwrite) the &lt;code&gt;log10&lt;/code&gt; name we originally imported from the Python standard library with one from numpy. This is normally a bad idea.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can see is that there's actually a pretty clear relationship between rule of law scores and GDP per capita, after a log transformation. The way to read this graph is that as GDP per capita increases by a factor of 10, rule of law scores seem to increase by, oh, 15 points or thereabouts. This relationship is much harder to see on the original scatterplot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log-transforming data relating to money is often a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Centering-and-Scaling"&gt;Centering and Scaling&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Centering-and-Scaling"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centering and scaling is carried out as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtract the mean of the variable from each of its values ("centering" --- this effectively converts the mean of the variable to zero)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide each variable by its standard deviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can easily use more numpy functions to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[15]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;center_scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# this applies to an entire pandas column&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sigma&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this will ultimately do is reduce a variable to what we might call &lt;em&gt;standard deviation units&lt;/em&gt;.  Let's look at another example.  In the dataset we're working with, the variable &lt;code&gt;hprop&lt;/code&gt; is the heritage foundation &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/index/property-rights"&gt;property rights score&lt;/a&gt; for 2012, and &lt;code&gt;assoc_org&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;a href="https://freedomhouse.org/"&gt;Freedom House&lt;/a&gt; associational and organizational rights score.  Observe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[16]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;State&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;hprop&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;assoc_org&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;RoLScore&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, again, they're on different scales, which might make it a bit difficult to compare them, especially later on when we try to figure out the magnitude of their relationship with something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose we learn from statistical analysis that a one-unit change in the Freedom House score predicts a one-unit change in the Rule of Law Score, but it takes a five-unit change in the Heritage Foundation score to predict a one-unit change in the Rule of Law Score.  What does that mean in terms of the relative predictive power of those two variables?  It's hard to tell, because they're not on a common scale.  A one-unit change in the Freedom House score could be a really big difference, while a five-unit change in the Heritage Foundation score could be a really small difference. They're hard to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's standardize, a.k.a. center and scale, them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we can see that the two variables are on a common scale.  The scale, as I said, is in standard deviation units. In other words, looking at the first row of the table above, we can say that Albania is 0.69 standard deviations below the mean on property rights, and 0.2 standard deviations below the mean on associational/organizational freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about this in terms of the analytic question I posed above, this would allow us to compare the relationship of the two scales on some common third variable---we might say, for example, that a 1 standard deviation increase in property rights predicts a 1 standard deviation increase in the rule of law, while it takes a 3 standard deviation increase in freedom of association to do the same.  This isn't a panacea for comparison, but it can help in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard technique for measuring the relationship between one or more continuous independent variables and a continuous dependent variable is linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of linear regression can be expressed simply. A linear regression is a line (or some more dimensional geometric thingy) that maps the independent variables to the best predicted value for the dependent variable.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;p&gt;The standard technique for measuring the relationship between one or more continuous independent variables and a continuous dependent variable is linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of linear regression can be expressed simply. A linear regression is a line (or some more dimensional geometric thingy) that maps the independent variables to the best predicted value for the dependent variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's grab some data (we'll use the stuff from my book again to make it easy) and take a look at an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like there's a strong relationship between these variables (which is to be expected---they're measures, of, respectively, a country's level of political pluralism and its protections for freedom of association---obviously, countries that respect people's freedom to join groups are likely to get more diverse groups!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of linear regression is: suppose we draw a straight line, the &lt;em&gt;regression line&lt;/em&gt;, through that graph in such a way as to minimize the distance between the line and the data points on there.  (We actually minimize the squared distances, for mathematical reasons we won't bother with here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may recall from middle school, lines are described by an equation of the form&lt;/p&gt;
$$y=mx+b$$&lt;p&gt;which translates to "for everything on the x axis, multiply its value by m and then add b, and you get the corresponding value for the y axis."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equation describing our regression line will represent our best prediction for values of y, given values of x. And the distances we minimize are the errors for that prediction, also known as the &lt;em&gt;residuals&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll talk about what most of this stuff means, but for now, just look down into the second sub-table where it says "Intercept" and "assoc_org".  The first column of that table provides the coefficients.  Where assoc_org is x and pol_plur is y, this is equivalent to saying that the regression line is&lt;/p&gt;
$$y = 1.2551x + 0.5877$$&lt;p&gt;and if you look at the chart, that looks about right.  (Let's put a grid on there to make it clearer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see how, for example, 10 on the x axis hits the regression line just a little bit above 12.5 (should be around 13) on the y axis.  Our linear regression looks about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The string formula in the call to statsmodels, incidentally, is just the easiest way to compose a regression in Python. &lt;code&gt;smf.ols(formula='pol_plur ~ assoc_org', data=df)&lt;/code&gt; means "run an ordinary least squares (ols) regression with pol_plur as the dependent, or y, variable, and assoc_org as the independent variable.  &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/example_formulas.html"&gt;Here's a description of how that formula system works&lt;/a&gt;.  Generally you should use the fomula system with statsmodels regressions, in part because for some silly reason only when using the formulas does statsmodels calculate an intercept for our regression line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about it visually for a second, our regression line actually describes the predicted value of our dependent variable for every value of our independent variable.  The distance between the line and our plotted datapoints represents our residuals.  With a bit more plotting work, we can visualize our residuals directly on the plot (don't worry about this code).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing about regression is that we don't have to limit ourselves to one variable.  Here's something we can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[9]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;formula&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;pol_plur ~ assoc_org + free_expr&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;multires&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;multi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;multires&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the coefficients have the same meaning, they just describe a plane rather than a line, of the form $y = mx + nz + b$ where we've added z to for free_expr, and n= 0.4086.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the plane that minimizes squared distance between itself and the data we have, but now in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the coefficients on assoc_org and the intercept have changed. This is to be expected.  Conceptually, what this is doing is capturing the relationship between each of the independent variables x and z, if we held the other one constant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to be really fancy, we can even make a 3d plot of this regression plane.  Though this is typically not very useful, as it's kind of hard to see useful things in 3d plots. Still, I'll do it to show off. (Again, no need to pay attention to this code. And I'm not even going to try to put in lines for the residuals here.  If you want to get into 3d plotting, I recommend using a library that lets you work with interactive plots that you can drag around with the mouse and stuff---two good ones are bokeh and plotly.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the least you need to know to make sense of this.   The bottom box (Omnibus and Durbin-Watson and all that) are tests for the assumptions of regression; we'll talk about them in a later lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle box has our coefficients, and then it has t-tests and p-values for the independent variables, which we can interpret more or less as usual. It also constructs 95% two-tailed confidence intervals, which are the last two columns. Here, our p values are for the two independent variables sufficiently low that statsmodels doesn't even bother displaying them. (They're not actually zero---they're never actually zero.) And, consistent with that, the confidence intervals don't include zero.  (N.b., coefficients, p-values, and confidence intervals don't mean much on the intercept.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first box, the most important things are the R-squared, which is a measure of the goodness of fit of our model, that is, the extent to which the model has enough information in it to account for all the variation in our dependent variable (as you should have seen in the readings).  The thing about R-squared is that it always increases when you add more independent variables, and what counts as a good r-squared varies by problem domain, so it isn't all that useful except to compare two models with the same number (or very close) of independent variables and large differences in r-squared. An adjusted r-squared is a way to attempt to account for the number of variables in the model (i.e., reduce it as you add more independent variables. For more, the &lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/regression-analysis-how-do-i-interpret-r-squared-and-assess-the-goodness-of-fit"&gt;Minitab blog has a nice explanation of r-squared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another goodness of fit measure is the f-statistic which essentially is a test of the null hypothesis that all of the regression coefficients are equal to zero. Again, &lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/what-is-the-f-test-of-overall-significance-in-regression-analysis"&gt;the Minitab blog has a nice explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be spending the next couple of weeks digging further into regression analysis---this is just the very basics, to get you an idea of the territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, we'll think about more ways to direct Python to do things repeatedly, or conditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with more loops. I showed you the while loop before, remember?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another kind of loop, called a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop, which is a little bit more complex. Here's how one looks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;letter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;letter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;c
a
t
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how that works: some kinds of data types in Python are known as &lt;em&gt;iterables&lt;/em&gt; (we'll look at what those are a bit later). Basically, that's anything that can be represented as a list of something else. So "cat" for example can be represented as a list of letters c, a, and t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; keyword starts our for loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next comes a variable name, which gets assigned to every element of the iterator in the body of the loop. Here the variable is &lt;code&gt;letter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next comes the keyword &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next comes the iterator we're iterating over, and then a colon as usual to start a block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the body of the loop, indented as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The for loop will loop over each element of the iterator, applying the body of the loop to each element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, loops (for loops or while loops) don't create their own scopes. That means that they can accidentally overwrite the value of some other variable in the scope that the loop is in.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;now, letter is: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common use of for loops is to do something a specified number of times. In order to do so, we use the built-in &lt;code&gt;range()&lt;/code&gt; function, which produces an iterator that starts at 0 and goes up to the number &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the number you pass to it.  (Actually, &lt;code&gt;range()&lt;/code&gt; technically isn't a function, but we'll treat it like one here. See the Python docs if you want more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;range()&lt;/code&gt; actually takes 3 arguments, &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stop&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;. Start is the number to start at, and has a default value of 0.  Stop is the number to stop at. Step is the number to go by, and has a default value of 1. That means that you can do more complicated ranges by supplying values in place of those defaults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you'll often find yourself wanting to do is to test whether something is, or is not, the case, and then have your program do different actions depending on the result.  For example, suppose you wanted to know whether a number was even or odd? Here's how you'd find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's go over that.  We know what defining a function looks like already, that was the last lesson. So let's look at the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first line of the body can pretty much be read straight off: if the number is equal to 0, then do the thing in the indented block to follow; in this case, return a scolding about trying to pretend that 0 is even or odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second line in the body starts with a weird keyword, &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; .  That's just a quirky Python shorthand for "else if".  It gives you a second alternative.  If that alternative is true, then run the code in the indented block to follow.  You can have as many &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; statements as you want in a conditional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; symbol is known as "modulo."  It basically means the same as the remainder in division, so what this block is asking is whether the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0 or not; if it is, then that means it's divisible by 2, i.e., even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final line is the last alternative, which starts with the keyword &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt;. That is what happens if nothing in the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt;s above is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things you should know about these conditionals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The different conditions are checked in order, and they stop after a match is found.  What that means is that changing the order can change the behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[14]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;broken_odd_or_even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Even!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Zero isn&amp;#39;t even or odd.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Odd!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;broken_odd_or_even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Even!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the wrong answer because we checked the wrong thing first. $0/2 = 0$ with no remainder, so the first condition is true, which means that it never gets to test the second condition, the conditional just resolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stuff after an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; is an expression that evaluates to a &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt;. A boolean is just one of the special values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;10 % 2 == 0&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;, whereas &lt;code&gt;5 % 2 == 0&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should be able to figure out the basic comparison operators for those examples. It's important to know that double equals &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; is used for comparision, while single equals &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; is used to assign something to a variable. It's a common mistake to mix them up (I still do it myself sometimes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Python you can use other things to stand in for booleans in conditionals. The rules are that most values act like &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; except for &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; itself (of course), strings with no characters in them, and empty compound data structures like lists and dictionaries (which we'll talk about later).  Things that can stand in for &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; are colloquially known as "truthy", while things that stand in for &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; are known as "falsy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[21]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;truthy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can omit the "else" statement in a conditional, what this just means is that if it doesn't meet a condition, it just won't do anything.  For example: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[31]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not doing anything&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[32]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;please can I do something?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functions end their execution whenever they see a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement (this is known as "sort-circuiting"), so if you have a conditional with returns in a function, then it never sees the rest of the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common idiom in Python is to take advantage of this last feature and just put the last alternative as a return statement outside of the conditional. For example, we could rewrite our &lt;code&gt;odd_or_even&lt;/code&gt; function as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[33]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;odd_or_even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Zero isn&amp;#39;t even or odd.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Even!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Odd!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function will work exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it gets 0, it'll go down the first branch, return on the spot and never see the rest of the return statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't get 0, but does get a number divisible by 2, it'll go down the second branch, and ditto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't get 0 or a number divisible by 2, it won't go down either branch of the conditional. But there's another line in the function!  And since it didn't return in the conditional, it gets to that line, which tells it to return "Odd!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Now-you-try!"&gt;Now you try!&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Now-you-try!"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like you to try and write a function, &lt;code&gt;fizzbuzz()&lt;/code&gt;, that takes a number, and returns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 and not 5,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 and not 3,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 5 and 3", and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the number itself, if it isn't divisible by 5 or 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I'd like you to print the result of that function for the numbers 1-100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, the data you work with (like the things assigned to variables) have &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt;, which specify the kinds of data they are and the things you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to understand this is to think about the difference between letters and numbers. While we can write both down, there are different things we can do to them.  It wouldn't make sense (except in an algebra context) to multiply and divide letters; it would't make sense to talk about a capital and a lowercase number 3.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python, the data you work with (like the things assigned to variables) have &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt;, which specify the kinds of data they are and the things you can do with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good way to understand this is to think about the difference between letters and numbers. While we can write both down, there are different things we can do to them.  It wouldn't make sense (except in an algebra context) to multiply and divide letters; it would't make sense to talk about a capital and a lowercase number 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly the same idea exists in programming. Numbers and letters are different things, and you can do different stuff to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Strings"&gt;Strings&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Strings"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Python, letters are made into &lt;em&gt;strings&lt;/em&gt;.  Usually, we write strings in python programs by enclosing them in quotes---single or double quotes, it doesn't make a difference (but we need to be consistent within a single string, and the other kind of quote just becomes an ordinary letter).  Here are some strings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a string.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[2]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;I am a string too, but I have trouble using contractions.&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[5]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;

&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy for me to use contractions, because I&amp;#39;ve been surrounded by double quotes, so I can use single quotes inside.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[5]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#34;It&amp;#39;s easy for me to use contractions, because I&amp;#39;ve been surrounded by double quotes, so I can use single quotes inside.&amp;#34;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Backslashes have special functions inside strings: they're used as &lt;em&gt;escape characters&lt;/em&gt; to allow you to include special kinds of letters.  For example, the special character &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; stands for a newline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

Congratulations! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Just kidding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;-Evil Professor&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Dear Students: 

Everybody gets an A!  Congratulations! 

Just kidding. 

-Evil Professor
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, you can use backslashes to escape quotes in strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[9]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quotestring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;And then she said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;sic &amp;#39;em, Rover!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; but Rover failed to sic.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quotestring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;And then she said &amp;#34;sic &amp;#39;em, Rover!&amp;#34; but Rover failed to sic.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also create multiline strings by enclosing them in triple quotes (again, of either kind).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[11]:&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Hi there!&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I&amp;#39;m a really long string over lots of lines.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s1"&gt;I can go on for as long as I want.  That makes me the coolest string.  Aren&amp;#39;t those other strings... &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s1"&gt;well...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s1"&gt;kinda lame?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Hi there!

I&amp;#39;m a really long string over lots of lines.

I can go on for as long as I want.  That makes me the coolest string.  Aren&amp;#39;t those other strings... 

well...

kinda lame?

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common feature that you might want is to combine multiple strings, or to substitute variables into strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy but kind of awkward way to combine strings is just to use the plus string to &lt;em&gt;concatenate&lt;/em&gt; them.  Imagine that you're doing a mail-merge function, for example. Here's how we might do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[12]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;concatenated_mail_merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Dear &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Send me the money you owe me or I&amp;#39;ll sue!!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;concatenated_mail_merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;John&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Paul&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;George&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Ringo&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Dear John:
Send me the money you owe me or I&amp;#39;ll sue!!
Dear Paul:
Send me the money you owe me or I&amp;#39;ll sue!!
Dear George:
Send me the money you owe me or I&amp;#39;ll sue!!
Dear Ringo:
Send me the money you owe me or I&amp;#39;ll sue!!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that gets very un-ergonomic.  Here's a better way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[14]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;cleaner_mail_merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Dear &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Thank you for the money, now I won&amp;#39;t sue you.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;cleaner_mail_merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Peter&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Paul&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Mary&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Dear Peter:
Thank you for the money, now I won&amp;#39;t sue you.
Dear Paul:
Thank you for the money, now I won&amp;#39;t sue you.
Dear Mary:
Thank you for the money, now I won&amp;#39;t sue you.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;format()&lt;/code&gt; is one example of a &lt;em&gt;string method&lt;/em&gt;.  A string method is a special kind of function that you call only on a string, which you call by putting a period and then the function call after it.  Most types in Python have their own special methods (and we'll learn a bit more about why this is the case when we learn what object-oriented programming is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some more string methods, which should be self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[15]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;this is a short short string
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of others, and you should go look at the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to see a list of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important feature of strings is that you can treat them like a sequence of individual letters.  And you can use what's known as subset notation to get at individual letters or groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[18]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mystring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cats are the best&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mystring&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;c
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in Python starts counting at 0, so &lt;code&gt;mystring[0]&lt;/code&gt; means "get me the first letter in the string at mystring.  You can also do ranges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[19]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;abcdef&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[19]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;abc&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;code&gt;range()&lt;/code&gt; function we looked at before, the subset notation allows us to specify a start and an end, and then it gives us from the start through &lt;em&gt;one before&lt;/em&gt; the end.  So in our example above, we got the 0th, the 1st, and the 2nd letters in the string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you noticed, the elements of the subset are separated by colons.  We can add a third &lt;em&gt;step&lt;/em&gt; element, again, just like in range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of legal data is in string form (think about the texts of cases!) so we'll be spending quite a bit of time thinking about strings through this course. This is just a taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Numbers-(integers-and-floats)"&gt;Numbers (integers and floats)&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Numbers-(integers-and-floats)"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually two kinds of numbers in Python.  The simplest are integers (or ints), or whole numbers, without a decimal.  Like 1, 2, and 3.  You can do what you would normally expect with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier versions of Python, you couldn't divide two integers and get a decimal, you'd get another integer, even if they didn't divide evenly. So you'd divide 5 by 2 and get 2.  This isn't a problem in Python 3, but be careful if you end up using Python 2 somehow (not a good idea)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[38]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;0&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All numbers in Python are represented in binary "under the hood."  What that means is that decimal numbers, called &lt;em&gt;floats&lt;/em&gt;, aren't actually exact.  They're just approximations, because decimal floats can't be exactly represented in binary. The &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html"&gt;Python Documentation&lt;/a&gt; has a nice explanation of the fact, and here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[39]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[39]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;False&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[41]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[41]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;0.19999999999999996&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can actually be a problem when you're doing math, especially with small numbers, and especially repeatedly, as floating point inaccuracy can compound on itself and give freakishly wrong results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers who fail to take this problem into account can kill people. Seriously: during the first Iraq war, a Patriot missile &lt;a href="http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/patriot.html"&gt;failed to intercept an Iraqi Scud&lt;/a&gt; because of floating point math errors, causing the death of 28 American soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest fix for this is to not do anything important with floating point arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some uses (like calculations with money) you can just use integers.  For example, instead of doing math with dollars and cents, just use cents and multiply everything by 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most languages have &lt;em&gt;numerics libraries&lt;/em&gt; to mitigate floating point problems for applications where you need accurate decimals (like stats!). In Python, we use &lt;a href="http://www.numpy.org/"&gt;Numpy&lt;/a&gt; for this, and later on in the course we'll give it some work to do. Most of the stats packages you'll ever see in Python are built on Numpy, and the implementers are (obviously) aware of the problems with floating point calculations, so they work around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ints and floats can be converted to one another, though obviously going from float to int loses data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[42]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[42]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;1.0&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[43]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[43]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;1&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[45]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[45]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;1&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, converting a float to an int just truncates it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also read numbers from strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[46]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[46]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;2&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[47]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;1.5&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[47]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;4.5&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can convert floats and ints to strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[48]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[48]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;1.5&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Other-Basic-Types"&gt;Other Basic Types&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Other-Basic-Types"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've already seen the special &lt;em&gt;boolean&lt;/em&gt; values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;.  We've also seen the special value &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, which represents nothing, and usually is seen when you assign the result of a function that doesn't return anything to a variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up on our conditionals lesson, this is a good time to introduce the concept of compound conditionals that evaluate to a boolean.  You can sort of represent basic logic this way, using the operators &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt;. They work about how you'd expect (and, just like in math, you can use parantheses to organize compound expressions and make your intention clear.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[50]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pet store&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;pet store
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how I said that values in Python can be Truthy or Falsey?  Well, it turns out that the way &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing"&gt;these boolean operators&lt;/a&gt; work is that they return the stuff that they work with, and then that's evaluated for truthiness or falsiness. They don't actually evaluate to a boolean (I lied to you a moment ago.)  So, if we look at what &lt;code&gt;"cat" and "dog"&lt;/code&gt; actually returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[51]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[51]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;#39;dog&amp;#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened there is that &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; tries to return the first falsey value it sees, or the last value if it doesn't see a falsey value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; returns the first truthey value it sees, or the last value if it doesn't see any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you've seen, you can iterate over lists with a loop.  Indeed, lists are the most common data structure in Python for such tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One extremely important fact about lists in Python is that they are &lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;/em&gt;.  By this, I mean that you can have a list, assigned to a name, and you can change its contents without changing its name or the relationship between that list and the variable. Indeed, lists have a bunch of methods that are intended to mutate them.  Let's see some, eh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;list_of_strings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;fish&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;counterexample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might expect the &lt;code&gt;.append()&lt;/code&gt; method to work sort of like the &lt;code&gt;.upper()&lt;/code&gt; method for strings, where it returns a new instance of the data type.  But, as you'll see, it doesn't:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that the &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; method doesn't return anything is because it mutates the original list: now the original list has a new word in it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutation is useful, but it's also perilous. In Jupyter Notebooks, in particular, it's easy to mess things up.  For example, suppose I had realized I'd made a mistake in some complex code cell where I'd run a bunch of mutating functions, and so I tweaked something and ran it again.  Then, way down the line, like 50 cells later, I might find that I had, say, the word &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; twice in my list rather than just once!  This can be a very difficult problem to debug.  (The easiest solution is usually to go up to the top of the screen and click "Kernel" and then "Restart &amp;amp; Run All"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another trap with mutable lists is that you can actually change them in functions without using the &lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; keyword. Why?  Well, because scope is about controlling which variable name refers to what, not what's inside them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's right.  We didn't actually make a second list when we returned the list out of the function.  We actually just assigned the same list to a second variable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a general principle of Python lists: when you assign them to a new variable, it doesn't make a copy, it just adds another variable pointing to the same list; when you change one, you change the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be really annoying behavior, it's actually one of my least favorite things about Python. It means it's easy to screw up your lists accidentally. And it's a big way that beginners get tripped up. A good rule of thumb for avoiding problems is to never mutate the original list in either a function or a loop.  Instead, create a new blank list (which you can create with &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) and then add things to that.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more sophisticated ways of dealing with these problems, which we can talk about down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like strings, we can slice (subset) lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice trick about slicing lists is that slices return new lists, so they can help you get around mutability problems.  A secret trick to copy a list is to use an empty slice with all the elements represented by blank spots between the colons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be careful.  This just makes what's known as a &lt;em&gt;shallow&lt;/em&gt; copy: it doesn't copy lists within lists, so you can still accidentally mutate those.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Tuples"&gt;Tuples&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Tuples"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuples are surrounded by parentheses, and are like lists, except they're &lt;em&gt;immutable&lt;/em&gt;---what that means is that you can't change them. There isn't an append or a sort or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that doesn't mean they're useless, because you can concatenate them with a plus sign (you can do that with lists too) and assign them to new variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(1, 2, 3, 4)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, even though something's immutable, it doesn't mean that you can't reassign the name, it just means you can't muck around with the contents.  So this works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can't do things like assigning to slices---you could do that with lists, but not with tuples.  (You also can't do it with strings.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Dictionaries"&gt;Dictionaries&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Dictionaries"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other main complex data type is the dictionary, or "dict".  That's how Python stores associations between names and other data in a list-like form.  For example, think of a telephone directory, that associates names with numbers.  You could easily represent that with a Python dict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[25]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phonebook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Joe Schmoe&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5551212&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Jill Schmill&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;911&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Jack Schmack&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8675309&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax should be self-explanatory: curly brackets around the edges, then pairs of a name, or &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt;, followed by a colon, followed by a &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; for that key, where all the pairs are separated by commas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phonebooks, unlike lists and tuples, don't have an order to them. Instead, you access them by their keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[26]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;phonebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Jack Schmack&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;8675309
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionaries are also mutable, and you can add a new key or change the value attached to a key just by assigning to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[27]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;{&amp;#39;Joe Schmoe&amp;#39;: 5551212, &amp;#39;Jill Schmill&amp;#39;: 911, &amp;#39;Jack Schmack&amp;#39;: 8675309, &amp;#39;Paul Gowder&amp;#39;: 3843202}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can iterate over a list's keys, values, or items (as key-value tuples) with, respectively, the &lt;code&gt;keys()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;values()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;items()&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[30]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;phonebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;(&amp;#39;Joe Schmoe&amp;#39;, 5551212)
(&amp;#39;Jill Schmill&amp;#39;, 911)
(&amp;#39;Jack Schmack&amp;#39;, 8675309)
(&amp;#39;Paul Gowder&amp;#39;, 3843202)

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of those methods act like lists, but they aren't really lists---they have a special property called &lt;em&gt;laziness&lt;/em&gt; which means that they don't actually exist in memory until you use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't support indexing because it's not a real list.  But you can make it one by slapping a call to a &lt;code&gt;list()&lt;/code&gt; constructor function around it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lesson I'm just going to describe the main libraries that we'll see when we work with data in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Numpy"&gt;Numpy&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Numpy"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numpy is the first library we work with.  By convention, it's imported with &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;.  Numpy really provides two things to our workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math that goes faster than unadorned Python could do it---which is important when you're doing statistics, because under the hood computational stats can take a lot of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lesson I'm just going to describe the main libraries that we'll see when we work with data in Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Numpy"&gt;Numpy&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Numpy"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numpy is the first library we work with.  By convention, it's imported with &lt;code&gt;import numpy as np&lt;/code&gt;.  Numpy really provides two things to our workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math that goes faster than unadorned Python could do it---which is important when you're doing statistics, because under the hood computational stats can take a lot of calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convenient data structures as well as functions that operate on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about number 2 for a minute.  Numpy provides special numeric types which you don't need to worry about, but also the array, which is like a Python list, but with special properties that make it more useful for mathematical operations.  The other main Python data libraries tend to assume that you're working with arrays, or something that can be converted with arrays---but lists can be pretty seamlessly converted to arrays, so that's ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other great part of number 2 is that numpy lets you do math on entire arrays as well as individual numbers.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mynums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mynums&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[ 2  4  6  8 10]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See what I did there?  I just multipled the entire array by 2 in one go.  You couldn't do that with ordinary Python lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numpy also provides a lot of convenience functions, for example, for calculating mean and standard deviation. We won't go through them here, but just will introduce them as they come up in other lessons.  If you're curious about the menu of options provided, however, check out the documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.math.html"&gt;mathematical functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.random.html"&gt;random sampling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.statistics.html"&gt;statistical functionality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numpy is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; package with tons more stuff, and also really complicated features to handle things like multidimensional data.  But you won't need to worry about that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Pandas"&gt;Pandas&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Pandas"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pandas is a library that helps us work with structured data (like Excel-spreadsheet-type data), which is what we'll be focusing on for the statistics work in this course. By convention, we &lt;code&gt;import pandas as pd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandas is the library you'll use to read in data from things like CSV and Excel spreadsheets. (Note: it's usually better to just export an Excel spreadsheet, or google docs, or whatever else, to CSV format and then ingest it in Python from there.  Excel can be a bit of a monster to deal with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pandas data format is called a &lt;code&gt;DataFrame&lt;/code&gt;.  You can think of it as Python's version of a spreadsheet.  Let's look at one.  I'll just pull down a CSV of data from my own book to play with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;http://rulelaw.net/downloads/rol-scores.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can look at the first few rows of data with the &lt;code&gt;head()&lt;/code&gt; method on a dataframe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[4]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[4]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I apologize for the fact that the headings of this table might not be properly aligned with the data below them on the website.  I'm working on this problem. But you can look in the lessons github repo, and it'll be better formatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can treat a Pandas DataFrame kind of like a dictionary where the keys are the columns.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[5]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;State&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also create new columns by assigning things to them, often by applying mathematical transofmrations to other columns.  For example, we could create a column in our current dataframe that does a bunch of silly math to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Under the hood, Pandas columns use Numpy arrays with some extra juice on them, so we can do the same stuff we did before like multiplying a whole column with something in one fell swoop.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also access subtables of a DataFrame by passing a list of columns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's lots more to do with Pandas as well.  I've assigned an introduction from DataCamp for this week in &lt;a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python-for-data-science"&gt;chapter 2 of this lesson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Matplotlib/Seaborn"&gt;Matplotlib/Seaborn&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Matplotlib/Seaborn"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matplotlib is the Python library that handles data visualization.  For the most part, however, we won't be working with matplotlib directly. It has a really bad API. Like, terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we'll be using seaborn.  Again, the convention among Python data people is to import it using a short name: &lt;code&gt;import seaborn as sns&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaborn provides us with some very fancy and easy to use plots. It can handle Pandas columns, Numpy arrays, ordinary Python lists, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't show more than one example here because there's another lesson covering several visualizations, but check out the official seaborn &lt;a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html"&gt;example gallery&lt;/a&gt; for the cool stuff you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, before you can get plots to show up in jupyter notebooks, you probably have to do &lt;code&gt;%matplotlib inline&lt;/code&gt; to tell the notebook to render plots within the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[9]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt; inline
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pairplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;RoLScore&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;pol_plur&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;free_expr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;assoc_org&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;per_auto&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[9]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;seaborn.axisgrid.PairGrid at 0x1108aeda0&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For example, if you want to do a hypothesis test, you'd go there.  Statsmodels has more robust functionality, more or less, but also pretty terrible documentation, weird rules about what you have to import, etc.  I'll probably grab bits and pieces of each library as we go forward into our stats section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example from statsmodels. Don't worry too much about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, we're going to very quickly rip through the basic hypothesis tests, their uses, and how to achieve them in Python.  I won't spend a lot of time on this, because the mathematical details are covered in the assigned reading, and, at any rate, I think for practical purposes regression analysis is more important for lawyers.  Also, this is basically AP/undergrad stats material, so you've probably seen it somewhere already.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;p&gt;In this lesson, we're going to very quickly rip through the basic hypothesis tests, their uses, and how to achieve them in Python.  I won't spend a lot of time on this, because the mathematical details are covered in the assigned reading, and, at any rate, I think for practical purposes regression analysis is more important for lawyers.  Also, this is basically AP/undergrad stats material, so you've probably seen it somewhere already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coverage:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chi-square&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher's exact test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binomial test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;F-test/Anova&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic nonparametric t-test alternative (Wilcoxon/Mann Whitney)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of others, but this is the sort of standard menu of the basic stuff.  For guidelines of which to choose when, see &lt;a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/"&gt;this page from UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use: test relationship between categorical variables, test whether two samples drawn from the same distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal example: The population of registered voters/drivers license holders/etc. is X% women and Y% men; the jury pool is A% women and B% men. Should we believe that the potential jurors were selected from the whole population? P-value means how likely would we be to get the observed distribution from the underlying population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic idea: Take a crosstabulation (a.k.a. contingency table) of the sample, and calculate what the expected values of the cells in the table would be from the population.  See if they're crazy different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking with our jury example, suppose we had the following data on our underlying population and our jury pool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|                  | Women | Men  |
|------------------|-------|------|
| Not in Jury Pool | 4850  | 4650 |
| In Jury Pool     | 150   | 350  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3900058/"&gt;A nice article describing some of the assumptions of chi-squared in more detail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, I might feel comfortable rejecting the null hypothesis that the jury pool came from the underlying population with a p-value that low. Or, same idea different phrasing, I might reject the null hypothesis that gender and being called to jury service are independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;maybe not&lt;/em&gt;, because chi-squared is known to be sensitive to sample size---big samples can produce really big test statistics, and hence really small p-values, sort of arbitrarily.  So maybe we should think of a different test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Fisher's-exact-test"&gt;Fisher's exact test&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Fisher's-exact-test"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher's exact test is an alternative to the chi-squared that used to be a lot less popular before computational power went through the roof.  As the name suggests, it produces better estimates than chi-squared, but at the cost of computational complexity, so even today it's rarely used for big contingency tables (you could use chi-squared for a 4x4 table, a 9x9 table, etc.)  Traditionally, Fisher's exact test is used for small samples that are inappropriate for chi-squared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's never wrong to conduct an extra test!  (Well, it's wrong if you're doing research and you don't report them all.  We'll talk about this later.  Report every damn test you conduct.)  So let's try it on our big contingency table here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also significant!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, that assigning two things to the result of a single function thing that we just did with &lt;code&gt;oddsratio, p = fisher_exact(crosstab)&lt;/code&gt; is known as &lt;em&gt;tuple unpacking&lt;/em&gt;.  the &lt;code&gt;fisher_exact&lt;/code&gt; function actually returns a tuple &lt;code&gt;(oddsratio, pvalue)&lt;/code&gt;, and we can just assign them to distinct variables all in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="Binomial-test"&gt;Binomial test&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Binomial-test"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binomial tests are another count data test, basically the same as Fisher's test except that Fisher's test is based on the hypergeometric distribution, used for sampling without replacement, and the binomial test is based (surprise surprise!) on the binomial distribution, used for sampling with replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binomial tests are used mainly to test for significant difference from a known binomial distribution.  For example, you'd use a binomial test to come to a conclusion about whether a coin is fair---coin flips are distributed according to a binomial distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example legal application would be, perhaps, coming to a conclusion about the prosecution/defense bias of a single judge on granting defense motions to dismiss at the close of the prosecution's case. Given an assumed probability of granting motions to dismiss brought by the defense in the district (based on the observed proportion of same), how likely is it that our judge's motions to dimiss were generated by the same process that generated the district as a whole?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;0.05792939694561368

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we probably wouldn't reject the null hypothesis that our judge's motion decisions are generated by a process with the same probability as the population as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom_test.html"&gt;scipy docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T-test"&gt;T-test&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#T-test"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use: comparing two means (Sample mean to hypothesized mean, difference in means, etc. --- there are different flavors of the T test for these situations) from samples where you have all the data (not just frequencies), and you have interval data (that is, proper numbers, not just categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basic idea: like the Z test (which is just a hypothesis test based on the normal distribution), but more robust to smaller sample sizes, where the central limit theorem doesn't give you quite as much confidence.  The T distribution has "fatter tails" than the normal distribution, so it'll give you higher p values for the same difference--- it's more conservative.  As sample size increases, the T distribution approaches the normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal example: suppose we think that African-Americans are being charged higher mortgage origination fees than whites.  We might collect a bunch of closing documents from the two groups and then run a t-test.  (Though note that this wouldn't be nearly enough to establish that actionable discrimination is happening, in part because we would need to control for other variables---wait till we get to the regression section.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that there are slightly different t-tests for independent data (i.e., two different groups of borrowers), and related or "paired" data (a common example given is student exam scores before and after some method of instruction, where each datapoint in the first sample is associated with a particular datapoint in the second).  There are actually &lt;a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/basic-statistics/inference/supporting-topics/tests-of-means/types-of-t-tests/"&gt;others as well&lt;/a&gt;, but those will serve for the most immediately useful ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in scipy.stats, the paired sample version is &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html"&gt;ttest_rel&lt;/a&gt;, and the independent sample version is &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html"&gt;ttest_ind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see an example here, we'll generate some fake data from normal distributions with different means.  (I'm too lazy to type it in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to use numpy's &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.seed.html"&gt;random seed&lt;/a&gt; functionality. What this does is basically picks the point at which pseudo-random numbers are selected---it means that the random draws will still be random enough, but if you run the code from here on in, it'll be the same for you as well, you won't get different random numbers, and hence will get identical results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can very easily reject the null hypothesis that the means of the two groups are the same.  Which, obviously, since I generated the fake data from distributions that big different means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I simulated data that would be expected to work particularly well with a T test: both populations had the same standard deviation (the &lt;code&gt;ttest_ind&lt;/code&gt; function &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html"&gt;gives you an option&lt;/a&gt; to apply a standard correction if that's not true), and both were generated by a normal distribution. You should be careful with T tests if those aren't true, as you could get bogus results.  Also, these are all independent draws---if the data aren't independent, if, for example, the result the third white borrower gets depends in some way on what some other borrower got, then a T test is not appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are actually some controversial details about whether the underlying data needs to really be from a normal distribution for T tests, but there are nice nonparemetric alternatives (I'll explain what that means in a minute), so a good rule of thumb is that when data deviates too far from a normal distribution, just go with one of those instead.  (Unless you have a large sample. Then you'll be pretty ok in most cases.  Many people say "large" is over 30.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, a standard way to see whether or not your data deviates from a normal distribution is to produce what's known as a q-q plot, which plots your data against a theoretical distribution. Unsurprisingly, scipy provides a function &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.probplot.html"&gt;called probplot&lt;/a&gt; for this.  (Actually, there are technical quibbles about q-q plots vs probability plots, but, for practical purposes, what you want is a plot against a distribution and that's what you get here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of other ways to come to some conclusion about the necessary assumptions for t-tests--- scipy contains &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.levene.html"&gt;tests for equal variances&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.shapiro.html"&gt;for normality&lt;/a&gt;, and so on and so on.  But, again, another solid solution is just to use a nonparametric test, which I'll talk about after talking about ANOVA and the F test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the minitab blog has two nice posts about understanding T tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-t-values-and-t-distributions"&gt;T Values and Distributions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics-2/understanding-t-tests-1-sample-2-sample-and-paired-t-tests"&gt;Varieties of T Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F-Test/ANOVA"&gt;F-Test/ANOVA&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#F-Test/ANOVA"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This (the one-way ANOVA, which follows the F distribution) is what you use to compare a bunch of means all at once. A significant p-value suggests that there's some difference between them, but doesn't tell you which one. Otherwise, it's basically the same (and rests on similar assumptions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let's think about the current debates in college admissions, in which there's a claim that affirmative action discriminates against Asian-Americans. But also lots of white people claim that affirmative action discriminates again them, and ostensibly benefits other racialized groups.  One way we might take a first pass at figuring out if there's even a real difference is to compare whites, Asian-Americans, and everybody else.  (Again, this doesn't entail that there's discrimination, but it's a starting point.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our example here, I'm going to try something a little funky.  I'm going to generate a bunch of distributions of fake data, some of them are going to show a difference and some aren't, and then we'll try to detect which ones actually are different and see how accurate we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data will be SAT scores of admitted students to a hypothetical college, so the question will be: is there a difference among these groups in the average SAT score?  The &lt;a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_226.40.asp"&gt;mean and SD SAT score are 1060 and 195, respectively&lt;/a&gt;, so we will start with that as out canonical distribution.  In order to limit ourselves to the actual range of SAT scores (400-1600), we'll use a scipy function to generate a truncated normal, which is actually kind of obnoxious to use, but such is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_dumb_truncation_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;195&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a non-deterministic test.  Sometimes, data from the same distribution will look very different, sometimes data from different distributions will look the same.  But we did pretty well, two wrong out of 30!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other flavors of ANOVA too, but we won't worry about them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Nonparametric-alternatives-to-the-T-test"&gt;Nonparametric alternatives to the T test&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Nonparametric-alternatives-to-the-T-test"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we'll look at some nonparametric alternatives to the T test.  &lt;em&gt;Nonparametric&lt;/em&gt; means that some statistical tests don't require (or, as stats people say, "assume," but we really mean "require so you don't get the wrong answer") the underlying data fit any particular distribution (like normal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For paired data, we have the Wilcoxon signed rank test, provided by scipy.stats in &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.wilcoxon.html"&gt;wilcoxon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For unpaired data, we have the Wilcoxon ranked sum test, provided by scipy.stats in &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ranksums.html"&gt;ranksum&lt;/a&gt;, there is also the &lt;a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html#scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu"&gt;Mann-Whitney U test&lt;/a&gt; which is basically equivalent, and sometimes it's called the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tests are a little bit harder to understand---they aren't perfect substitutes for the T test, and, under some circumstances, it doesn't make sense to say that they're about equality of means.  (I've read some descriptions according to which the null hypothesis to be constructed is really about difference of medians, I've also seen references to difference in distributions more broadly.  So I won't say much more about it here, except to let you know that it exists, and that &lt;a href="https://data.library.virginia.edu/the-wilcoxon-rank-sum-test/"&gt;this explanation from UVA&lt;/a&gt; looks pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unavoidable fact of life for people who write code is error messages.  You're happily programming along, and then, all of a sudden, you get a massive screen of terrifying text telling you that &lt;em&gt;you screwed up!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do when you see an error is &lt;em&gt;be grateful&lt;/em&gt;.  Error messages are a good thing. Because you've asked the computer how to do something that it doesn't understand how to do, and if you don't get an error message, either the program would have to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) silently fail---that is, not do anything, and not tell you why, making it much harder to debug when your program doesn't work, or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) much, much worse: make some kind of guess about what you're trying to do, and do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Option b in particular can be a massive disaster. For example, the error generated by the code above was a result of my asking the list to fetch an item that it didn't exist. Remember: Python indices start at 0, so in &lt;code&gt;["cat", "dog", "bear"]&lt;/code&gt; the only indices that exist are 0, 1, and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some languages will actually let you access the index of their list-like data structures that is out of their range, and then just give you the contents of whatever is in memory at that location---which could (if the operating system sucks) be memory belonging to a different program, or it could be information that you don't want to be accessed in the current program.&lt;br&gt;
Imagine, for example, that your program just holds a list of user information and also holds passwords, and you have some function that users can call to get at the user information, but you accidentally started counting at 1 instead of 0 (a common "off-by-one error") when you wrote the program. All of a sudden, users try to get the last item in their list, and they get a password back instead... maybe someone else's!  This is a contrived example, but it's not all that different from stuff that &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3mgxb/the-internet-has-a-huge-cc-problem-and-developers-dont-want-to-deal-with-it"&gt;really happens in languages like C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, errors are awesome.  (There are still times your programs will go wrong without helping you out with errors, and we'll talk about figuring out what's going on there toward the end of this lesson, but let's start at the start.)  Let's figure out how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;look at the type of the error, which is at the very bottom of the error message.&lt;/strong&gt;  Typically the last line is always the first place to look, and, in the error above, it should be pretty obvious what happened once you see it.  IndexError means, as expected, that you tried to use an index that doesn't exist.  Note that up above we helpfully get the line that caused the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some other common errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Easy-errors"&gt;Easy errors&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Easy-errors"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;bear&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;cat
dogbear
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hah!  That was supposed to throw an error, but it turns out that Python has bizarre behavior where if you leave off a comma in a list of strings it just concatenates them. I literally discovered that while writing this lesson. I'll leave it here as an object lesson in why errors are good: if this happened to you in a real program you'd probably get subtly wrong behavior that would be hard to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_text output_error"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class="ansi-cyan-fg"&gt;  File &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-green-fg"&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;lt;ipython-input-3-08a169b2bac7&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-cyan-fg"&gt;, line &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-green-fg"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;    for x in [1, 2 3]:&lt;/span&gt;
                   ^
&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;SyntaxError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; invalid syntax
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that's more like it!  So what we see here is a syntax error.  That's a nice easy error to fix, because once you learn the language, it's usually just because of a typo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how the second-to-last line has a convenient little caret (arrow thing) pointing to the spot in the line &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; where the typo was?  That's sort of a normal thing for this kind of error: Python can't actually figure out where the typo is, but it can figure out where it all of a sudden started getting data in a format it didn't know how to process, so it shows you that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common typo: you forgot to put the closing quotation mark in (or you put the wrong quote in, as in the following example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, if you think through the logic of how Python's computer brain works, you can make sense of the error.  Python saw the opening of a string (in this case, &lt;code&gt;'the hat&lt;/code&gt;) but didn't see the end of it. And it got to the end of the line, but it was still looking for more string characters, because it never got a close quote indicating that the string was over!  Hence "EOL while scanning string literal"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different colors in the code in the Jupyter notebooks, incidentally, will often help you figure out this kind of syntax error.  Do you see how strings tend to be colored red?  When you see that &lt;code&gt;'the hat")&lt;/code&gt; is all red in your syntax highlighter, that should be a clue: the close parens is normally black!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[6]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's another easy one: you forgot to indent when you were supposed to.  Pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# verify the function works as expected before we start blowing it up: &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NameErrors are often going to be typoes.  Sometimes, however, they'll be scope errors, as in the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happened here?  Take a couple minutes and think about it. Then try some code of your own to see if you can make the error go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hint&lt;/strong&gt;: go back and look over the complex data types lesson from last week. What does the sort method on lists do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer coming soon.  Have you thought about it some?  Have you tried out some code to see if you can figure out how to get it to work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the answer is: the &lt;code&gt;sort()&lt;/code&gt; method of lists doesn't return a new, sorted list, it sorts the original list in place. So the code &lt;code&gt;for x in unsorted_list.sort():&lt;/code&gt; evaluates &lt;code&gt;unsorted_list.sort()&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;, which is what methods that just mutate in place return.  This means that the code I ran really is equivalent to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for x in None:
    print(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which obviously makes no sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, because you've mutated &lt;code&gt;unsorted_list&lt;/code&gt; it is no longer, well, unsorted, and if you were expecting to have access to its original, unsorted, form later, you will be unhappily surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[11]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unsorted_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;incidentally, here's the right way to do that: use the &lt;code&gt;sorted()&lt;/code&gt; function, which returns a new list and doesn't mutate the original&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[12]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unsorted_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;sorted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unsorted_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unsorted_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, whenever you see TypeErrors involving &lt;code&gt;NoneType&lt;/code&gt; it means that something you thought was going to return a value actually didn't.  Very often, that's because of functions that don't return anything. Sometimes it's also because of functions that were supposed to return something, but couldn't find anything to return, like network requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other kinds of type errors though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[13]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;my_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="ansi-green-fg"&gt;----&amp;gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ansi-green-fg"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class="ansi-green-fg"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; data&lt;span class="ansi-blue-fg"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold"&gt;      5&lt;/span&gt;             z &lt;span class="ansi-blue-fg"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; x &lt;span class="ansi-blue-fg"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; y

&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#39;int&amp;#39; object is not iterable&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, look at the last line first.  Remember that &lt;code&gt;my_func&lt;/code&gt; loops over something to try to multiply everything in it by everything in &lt;code&gt;[0, 1, 2]&lt;/code&gt;.  So you gotta give it something you can loop over.  And you can't loop over the number 3, this ain't Sesame Street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often get this kind of error by accidentally putting in the name of a function that doesn't take any arguments rather than calling it, i.e., typing &lt;code&gt;some_fancy_function + 5&lt;/code&gt; when I mean to type  &lt;code&gt;some_fancy_function() + 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;span class="ansi-red-fg"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;: my_func() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a TypeError (don't ask me why): wrong number of arguments to a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an error, even though it probably wasn't what you were expecting.  The reason is that the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; symbol is &lt;em&gt;overloaded&lt;/em&gt; in Python: you can use it to multiply numbers, or, if you do string * a number, you get repeated strings.  This is an important reminder: not every mistake will throw an error!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another situation where you would expect an error, but you don't get one.  Basically, what's happening here is that Python is silently coercing &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; to 1 and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; to 0 so that they have compatible types to the thing you're trying to &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; them with, namely, integers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, arguably, pretty bad behavior. Other languages are much stricter about the types of variables and don't let you make this kind of mistake. But the tradeoff is that those other languages are harder to program in---they make you follow lots more rules in order to get working code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Actually-difficult-errors"&gt;Actually difficult errors&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Actually-difficult-errors"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think there are two kinds of really common errors that can take forever to deal with: accidentally renaming things and errors generated from deep within complicated libraries.  (There are also many, many uncommon errors that you will see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of those are actually fairly difficult to show here, so we'll approach them when we see them in class (or the first time someone generates one of them out of the classroom)... watch this space for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, let's talk strategies for fixing silent errors.  Often times, you'll find out that your code is subtly wrong, and you won't know why---it'll just be producing the wrong answer.  Sometimes a freakishly wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to think about this task is as an attempt to narrow down where you made the mistake.  For example, suppose you have some complicated buggy function.  Let's say it does some math, and you're mysteriously getting the wrong answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

        &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# this is just shorthand for answer = answer + x. it&amp;#39;s not the bug.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;second_half_of_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[20]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;14&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14?  That doesn't look right.  And we can verify that it isn't right by using a non-idiotic way of summing the list, which happens to be built right into Python:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[21]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[21]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;15&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so how did we get the math wrong?  Other than by writing an idiotically complicated function.  Let's assume we can't just look at our code and see what we did.  (Experienced coders will be able to look at that one and see, it's a pretty basic oops.)  What we'd ideally like to to is be able to look inside the execution of the function and see what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fancy programmer types use what's called a &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pdb.html"&gt;debugger&lt;/a&gt; to do this---basically a debugger will let you pause your code at any point, and see what the values of the variables are and so forth.  See &lt;a href="https://davidhamann.de/2017/04/22/debugging-jupyter-notebooks/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more on how to use them in Jupyter Notebooks if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but really, most of the time, simple calls to &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; will help.  Let's dig into our function with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[22]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;complicated_sum_all_in_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;length_of_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;first_half_of_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length_of_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;second_half_of_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nums&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;round&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;length_of_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):]&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;second_half_of_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can get a bit more of a clue what's going on already.  We're using print calls to see the incremental answers (sums) being generated by our program, and it looks like the first one is wrong.  Why is the incremental sum starting at 2?  Shouldn't 0 + 1 be equal to 1?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's try more print statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now what we tried to do is print the numbers that are being added up, and we can see that it's starting with the wrong number.  It's taking the list &lt;code&gt;[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt; and only adding &lt;code&gt;[2, 3, 4, 5]&lt;/code&gt; together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should give you enough of a clue to figure out what went wrong in the code.  So here's a mini-homework assignment: fix the error in that function!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object-oriented programming&lt;/strong&gt; (OOP) isn't all that special, it's just a particular style of programming that Python is particularly well designed for.  This is a short lesson, we won't cover the theory of OOP, or features you might hear about elsewhere like "inheritance"---see your reading in the P4E book for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we have to say something about OOP in order to enable you to work with many Python libraries, which expect you to be able to instantiate objects and work with them.  So here's the short version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OOP is another kind of mental model for programming. It mostly is useful for organizing the abstractions in your code.  One of the key ideas is that groups of related data and functionality can be tied together in the form of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;class&lt;/strong&gt; is an abstract description of a kind of object. A class declaration will say what kind of things an object of that sort can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;instance&lt;/strong&gt; is an actual object that you create and make use of in the computer's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at a trivial example of a class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[1]:&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;vicious&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;timid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;sound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;woof.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;timid&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;understanding&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;inferior&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what you need to know about this code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functions belonging to a class are called &lt;strong&gt;methods&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can tell that they belong to the class because they are indented under the class declaration in the first line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every method takes a special parameter to refer to the object on which it is called as the very first parameter.  Here, we're using &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; for that, which is the Python convention, but you could use anything else.  When you call these methods, you don't supply the value for the self parameter.  We'll see how to call them in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every class has an &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; method.  The two underscores on either side of the name show you it's a special method (known as "magic methods" in Python slang... there are a number of those, but init is the most important).  This is the method that gets called when you &lt;strong&gt;initialize&lt;/strong&gt; a class, that is, create an instance of that class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All those references to &lt;code&gt;self.temperment&lt;/code&gt; are creating (the first time something is assigned to it) and either mutating or examining an &lt;strong&gt;attribute&lt;/strong&gt; (also called a property) of a particular instance.  Let's look at some examples of instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;goodboy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;doberman&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;vicious&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've created two different instances of &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; and each of them has its own set of instance properties.  Let's prove that by calling the bark method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[3]:&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[4]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;goodboy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;quiet&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things you can observe from those examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We instantiate a class by calling it as if it were a function.  We can pass parameters into its &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; method that way too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;doberman&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;goodboy&lt;/code&gt; have different &lt;code&gt;temperament&lt;/code&gt; properties, hence they make different sounds when we call their &lt;code&gt;bark()&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call a method on an instance by putting a period after the instance's name and before the method call.  We don't pass the instance into the call, but we do pass any other parameters (like &lt;code&gt;volume&lt;/code&gt; here) that we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instances are totally separate.  Nothing we do to &lt;code&gt;goodboy&lt;/code&gt; affects &lt;code&gt;doberman&lt;/code&gt; or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also modify existing instance attributes, and we can access them directly with the same dot notation.  Let's look at, then modify, doberman's attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[5]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;doberman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temperament&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, this is the bare minimum to understand what's going on when you see OOP code.  This will benefit you in the next lesson, where we'll look at some OOP code to run a simulation. It will also benefit you in interacting with Python libraries which often expect you to know how to instantiate an object, call methods on it, and access its properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions (or "regex"/"regexes") are one of the most powerful programming tools for lawyers. Essentially, regular expressions are a powerful specialized programming language built into other languages like Python, which allow you to express complicated text searching operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of this for lawyers should be obvious: lawyers have to deal with lots and lots and lots of documents, and sometimes need to search through those documents for specific information. If those documents are in electronic form, regular expressions can provide you with a much more powerful way of searching than what is built into ordinary applications.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions (or "regex"/"regexes") are one of the most powerful programming tools for lawyers. Essentially, regular expressions are a powerful specialized programming language built into other languages like Python, which allow you to express complicated text searching operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility of this for lawyers should be obvious: lawyers have to deal with lots and lots and lots of documents, and sometimes need to search through those documents for specific information. If those documents are in electronic form, regular expressions can provide you with a much more powerful way of searching than what is built into ordinary applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple example.  Suppose you've got a bunch of files. And suppose you're trying to find any document that contains a reference to specific dollar amounts---invoices, e-mails with discussions of financial matters, etc. One of the things you might do is search for anything in the usual format for representing dollars, i.e., a number with two digits after the decimal point, and, say, 1-8 digits before the decimal, maybe with commas in there.  (Let's suppose that you don't expect any bigger amounts of money to be at issue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's create some pretend data.  In a real task, we'd probably have these files on disk somewhere, or in a database, and we'd open every file, search it, and save the document if it matched. Also, for this technique to be useful in a real task, we'd usually have hundreds or thousands of dollars. For the purposes of demonstration, however, we can put a handful of fake texts in memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see what we did there?  We used one search to match both the dollar amount &lt;code&gt;$1,280,012.05&lt;/code&gt; and dollar amounts like &lt;code&gt;100.00&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;9.99&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; matching &lt;code&gt;100&lt;/code&gt; in the first example letter, which doesn't look like a dollar amount.  Try doing that with Google or Control-F (I think old versions of MS Word used to have something resembling regex capacity, but I can't find that in any online documentation anymore.  Sorry law review editors, but you might try saving into plain text formats in order to try tasks like searching for citations...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import re

pattern = r'\d*,?\d*,?\d{0,3}\.\d\d'

matches = []

for doc in docs:
    if re.search(pattern, doc):
        matches.append(doc)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of that code is pretty self-explanatory, but the one part that's new is the line where we define the pattern and has this wild &lt;code&gt;r'\d*,?\d*,?\d{0,3}\.\d\d'&lt;/code&gt; thing that sort of looks like Klingon.  Unsurprisingly, that's a regular expression pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very useful way to build regular expressions is to use an application that lets you enter in sample text and try out different regular expressions to see what they match.  My favorite is the free webapp &lt;a href="https://regex101.com/"&gt;Regex101&lt;/a&gt;. The neat thing about Regex101 is that it lets you save your examples and share them (using the little menu hamburger icon thingey on the left).  So I've created a saved version of this search with our sample text that shows exactly how it works.  &lt;a href="https://regex101.com/r/zu8XzP/1/"&gt;Check it out here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before we get to our complicated pattern, let's start simpler.  Regular expressions are basically just amped up search strings, and we know how to search, right?  We can use ordinary strings as regexes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's abstract out our search into a function, then let's look at some simple examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[4]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;search_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;doclist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;doclist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;re&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;doc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matches&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[5]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wise_statements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Dogs are ok, I guess&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Cats are better than dogs&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                   &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;search_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wise_statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[5]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, the first thing you should notice is that the regex pattern is a normal string, but with a lowercase r prepended to it.  The reason for the lowercase r is that it tells Python to ignore special characters in the string---instead of processing those characters in Python-ey ways, it'll process them in regex-ey ways.  You can just treat this as a rule: put a lowercase r before the string when you're making a regex pattern, and if you want the nitty-gritty technical details of why, look &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12871066/what-exactly-is-a-raw-string-regex-and-how-can-you-use-it"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing you should notice is that this successfully searched for the wise statements with "cat" in lowercase, but not capitalized: regex is case sensitive.  How to make it case-insensitive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[6]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[6]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;Cats are better than dogs&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we've done there is insert a special character sequence before the c, that said what we have to do afterward.  Specifically, we've inserted a special character that means "match in either case."  There are other ways we could have done this.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

 &amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By enclosing characters in brackets, we tell regex "match any of these characters" so that regex means "match either &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, followed by &lt;code&gt;at&lt;/code&gt;"  It achieves exactly the same thing as the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[8]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;search_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;[cC]at&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wise_statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[8]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;Cats are better than dogs&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#34;When looking at data, it&amp;#39;s always a good idea to start with a scatterplot&amp;#34;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened??  Well, the word "scatterplot" has the three letter sequence "cat" in it, so it matched.  Ooops.  How to fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[9]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;\b[cC]at\b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wise_statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[9]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The \b symbol says "there has to be a word boundary here" Basically, a word boundary means "not a letter or number," and the end of the string counts.  So this pattern now says "Match the word cat, capitalized or not, and not adjacent to any other letters or numbers."  This rules out "scatterplot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it also rules out "Cats"!  Because that has an s after it!  That's not what we wanted.  Time to make it a bit more complicated...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[10]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;search_docs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;\b[cC]ats?\b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;wise_statements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt output_prompt"&gt;Out[10]:&lt;/div&gt;




&lt;div class="output_text output_subarea output_execute_result"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;Cats are better than dogs&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;Professor Gowder has the best cat.&amp;#39;,
 &amp;#39;If you have a cat, you are cool.&amp;#39;]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question mark means "either zero or one of this character."  So now our pattern says "match the word cat or cats, not embedded in any other words, and capitalized or not."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have some idea of how regular expressions work---by mixing up special characters and normal characters to describe a pattern for a string---we can understand the one we started off with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;r'\d*,?\d*,?\d{0,3}\.\d\d'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a piece-by-piece translation of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\d&lt;/code&gt; any digit character (0, 1, 2...9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; apply the preceding character any number of times, including zero so &lt;code&gt;\d*&lt;/code&gt; means "any number of digits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;,?&lt;/code&gt; maybe a comma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;then we have any number of digits and maybe a comma again.  This is a little imprecise, our regex would match weird stuff like &lt;code&gt;1,000000,000.00&lt;/code&gt; but I don't really expect to see such a thing in a search of something like litigation documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\d{0,3}&lt;/code&gt;  This means "match any digit between 0 and 3 times."  Again, it is a little imprecise.  Our regex would match weird things like &lt;code&gt;.00&lt;/code&gt; on its own.  But again, I wouldn't expect to see such a thing in most realistic cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\.&lt;/code&gt;  This just means "match a period."  The problem is that a period is a special character in regex language (it means "any character"), so we need to &lt;em&gt;escape&lt;/em&gt; it with a backslash to tell the regex engine that we don't mean the special character, we mean the literal period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;\d\d&lt;/code&gt; two digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put together, our regex says "match any number of digits, maybe followed by a comma, followed by any number of digits, maybe followed by a comma, followed by 0-3 digits, followed by a period and two digits."  Which is a pretty good stab at something that looks like a dollar amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;now here's an exercise for you:&lt;/strong&gt;  You see those places up above where I said this regex is imprecise?  Try and find a regex that gets rid of the imprecision by not accepting funky numbers like &lt;code&gt;1,000000,000.00&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.00&lt;/code&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you out, I've put the imprecise regex and our bad examples into a &lt;a href="https://regex101.com/r/nuqA6i/1/"&gt;regex101 sample&lt;/a&gt;.  Try playing with it until you get it working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my solution, which also gets rid of the arbitrary limitation of only working with small dollar amounts, take a look at &lt;a href="https://regex101.com/r/7SCGT1/3"&gt;this regex101&lt;/a&gt;... but &lt;strong&gt;try on your own first.&lt;/strong&gt;  You don't get good at this stuff without practicing, and hunting down the information you don't know in order to solve problems.  (Incidentally, I'm deliberately making you hunt down information you don't know to fill in gaps to solve the problem sets too.  This is how problem sets work, actually---they're more student-search-driven instructional tools than testing tools.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions are a special language, built into but not part of the Python language---just about every other programming language also supports them, usually with identical or near-identical syntax (although some languages also give you special super-powerful syntax---the Perl programming language is particularly famous for its over-the-top regular expression capacity). And they're a great superpower!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about them, I highly recommend the &lt;a href="https://regexone.com/"&gt;Regexone&lt;/a&gt; tutorial.  One of the questions in our first problem set will probably require regular expressions (you could do it without, but it would be much harder), and going through that tutorial may help you.  I also recommend the official Python &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/regex.html"&gt;regex howto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more comprehensive but less readable documentation, &lt;a href="https://www.regular-expressions.info/"&gt;regular-expressions.info&lt;/a&gt; has a ton of stuff.  And always try out your regular expressions in something like regex101!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class, we went through how to make an API call end-to-end, to get a look at common tasks like figuring out documentation, using libraries, making HTTP requests, etc.  Over the weekend, practice with this API and others (you might also try the one at &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/api"&gt;opensecrets.org&lt;/a&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;/*!

&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lightly edited version of the notebook that we worked through in class on 1/22/19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In class, we went through how to make an API call end-to-end, to get a look at common tasks like figuring out documentation, using libraries, making HTTP requests, etc.  Over the weekend, practice with this API and others (you might also try the one at &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/api"&gt;opensecrets.org&lt;/a&gt;, see what you can learn programmatically about the world!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a bit more information that we didn't get to in class.  First, take a look at &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;the documentation for the requests library&lt;/a&gt; again.  Did we need to use the built-in Python &lt;code&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; library to get at the data we received, or was there another way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, as I mentioned in class, the &lt;a href="https://pymotw.com/3/"&gt;Python Module of the Week&lt;/a&gt; website is a great way to get much more readable documentation than the official docs have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, way at the bottom of this notebook (sorry for the length, by the way, there are some long data dumps that aren't going to display in the pretty box when we actually get it on the website), I used a weird syntax that you hadn't seen before.  In order to search for a senator whose phone number wasn't in the dataset we got from openstates, I used the following code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[x for x in senate if x["full_name"] == "Jeff Danielson"]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is known as a list comprehension.  Basically, it's a concise way of creating a list out of anything that you can loop over.  In the code above, remember that &lt;code&gt;senate&lt;/code&gt; was a variable pointing to a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is information about a particular Iowa senator.  The code above is equivalent to the loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;output = []
for x in senate:
    if x["full_name"] == "Jeff Danielson":
        output.append(x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at some more examples of list comprehensions to see how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[5]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;cat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;coyote&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;dog&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;biganimals&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;upper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;biganimals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;CAT&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;COYOTE&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;DOG&amp;#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That list comprehension was equivalent to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;mylist = []
for animal in biganimals:
    mylist.append(animal.upper())&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[7]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;only_cs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;mylist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;animal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;startswith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;only_cs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;cat&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;coyote&amp;#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shows that you can add a conditional to a listcomp by putting it at the very end.  You can also create a listcomp out of anything else that you can loop over, such as a string.  For example, here's a really pointless listcomp that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[9]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;iseven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;numberstring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;8675309&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;numberstring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;iseven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;


&lt;div class="output_area"&gt;

    &lt;div class="prompt"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="output_subarea output_stream output_stdout output_text"&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;[&amp;#39;8&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;6&amp;#39;]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"&gt;&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List comprehensions are super useful to concisely create lists without loops. They can also be abused to create dense, unreadable code. For example, remember the FizzBuzz example we looked at last week (which comes from &lt;a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/"&gt;this famous blog post&lt;/a&gt;)?  Well, here's one really pointless and stupid, but kind of cool looking, way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[11]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Fizzbuzz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;15&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Fizz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Buzz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="output_wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="output"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably shouldn't write code like that, though. ANYWAY. here are two nice tutorials on list comprehensions for more &lt;a href="https://dbader.org/blog/list-dict-set-comprehensions-in-python"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-list-comprehensions-in-python-3"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with no further ado, here's the code (with my API key removed, use your own!) we used in class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;
&lt;div class="input"&gt;
&lt;div class="prompt input_prompt"&gt;In&amp;nbsp;[2]:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="inner_cell"&gt;
    &lt;div class="input_area"&gt;
&lt;div class=" highlight hl-ipython3"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;apikey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;SECRET&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# note to students: publishing an API key on a public website is a bad idea.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# replace that value with the api key you got from opensecrets.org.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we do our scavenger hunt, here's a piece of useful information you should know: you can filter rows of a Pandas dataframe using something that returns a boolean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you have a DataFrame called copdf with police officer names in a column called "name" and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Pandas Filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we do our scavenger hunt, here's a piece of useful information you should know: you can filter rows of a Pandas dataframe using something that returns a boolean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you have a DataFrame called copdf with police officer names in a column called "name" and the number of tickets they've written in a column called "tickets."  You could use the code &lt;code&gt;copdf[copdf.tickets&amp;gt;100].name&lt;/code&gt; to get the names of all the cops with more than 100 tickets. (However, be careful about changing subsets of DataFrame like that---sometimes Pandas will change the original DataFrame when you make a change to a subset.  It's a good idea to &lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.copy.html"&gt;explicitly copy a dataframe&lt;/a&gt; before doing any changes to a subset of it that you don't want to leak into the original.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A scavenger hunt.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to work with houston_medicine.csv, a dataset that I've posted on ICON, and which supposedly featured in a sex discrimination lawsuit.  (n.b., this is a dataset that's been floating around the internet for a while; I can't find the original litigation; it was downloaded from &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hjmjerry/gender-discrimination/home"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegedly, the following describes the columns of the data: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dept 1=Biochemistry/Molecular Biology 2=Physiology 3=Genetics 4=Pediatrics 5=Medicine 6=Surgery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender 1=Male, 0=Female&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clin 1=Primarily clinical emphasis, 0=Primarily research emphasis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cert 1=Board certified, 0=not certified&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prate Publication rate (# publications on cv)/(# years between CV date and MD date)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exper # years since obtaining MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rank 1=Assistant, 2=Associate, 3=Full professor (a proxy for productivity)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sal94 Salary in academic year 1994&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sal95 Salary after increment to 1994&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone should go look for the following information.  When everyone has found everything, we'll go round getting code, running it on the main screen, and discussing.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the questions are deliberately ambiguous. Try to make an assumption about what I mean, but take note of when you do so, and we'll talk about the ambiguity afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many observations are there in the dataset? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you say about the distribution of salaries?  Does it look like the standard bell-shaped curve that we all know and love?  If not, why not? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the mean, median, and mode of salaries?  How do they change from year to year?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What data visualization would you use to get a look at the relationship between gender and salaries? What do we learn from that visualization? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we subdivide the dataset in some useful way to get more insight about the relationship between gender and salaries under different conditions?  Come up with something that helps us learn more, and visualize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people in the dataset make more than 450k a year?  What else do we know about them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many standard deviations away from the mean is the most highly-paid person in the dataset?  What about the lowest person?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the biggest department?  The smallest?  Can you order them from largest to smallest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's the most highly paid department?  What's the lowest paid department? What measure did you use to make that decision, and could a different measure have yielded different results?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition time: what's the most fancy data visualiation you can come up with to make of these data?  What's the most informative? (What would you want to know?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, what do you think you would want to know in order to figure out whether there's evidence of discrimination in this dataset.  What would your next steps be?  Come to some idea. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data"></category><category term="week5"></category></entry><entry><title>Week 5 Recap</title><link href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/week-5-recap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-13T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Paul Gowder</name></author><id>tag:sociologicalgobbledygook.com,2019-02-13:/week-5-recap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In week 5, we began by continuing our probability lecture from last week, and then, as an exercise, tried to prove the correct answer to the Monty Hall problem using Bayes Rule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A …&lt;/div&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In week 5, we began by continuing our probability lecture from last week, and then, as an exercise, tried to prove the correct answer to the Monty Hall problem using Bayes Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monty Redux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's that solution again.  Remember our formula for Bayes Rule: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, all the work is in figuring out what A and B are, and then plugging in.  As a guide to figuring out A and B, remember that conceptually what we're trying to do is update our estimate of the likelihood that the car is behind the door we already picked, given our new evidence (that Monty opened a specific other door).  For convenience, we can label the door we picked as Q, the door Monty opened as R, and the door that was neither picked nor opened as Z, and then what we're after is the conditional probability that the car is behind Q given that Monty opened R. Then it makes the most sense to formalize B as car is behind Q, and A as Monty opened R. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the numerator of our fraction on the right side of the formula.  What's &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A|B)\)&lt;/span&gt;?  Well, if the car is behind Q, then Monty has a choice between opening door R or door S, and assuming he doesn't want to give away any more free information about where the car is, we have to assume that he picks one of the two at random.  So &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(A|B) = \frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. And &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(B)\)&lt;/span&gt; is just our prior on door Q having the car, which is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{3}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  (I'm using fractions here because they're all really simple fractions and it makes the arithmetic easier at the end, but these are still probabilities, not odds.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the denominator takes a bit more work to figure out.  What's the unconditional probability of Monty opening door R?  Well, we need to use the law of total probability again.  Since the only three states of the universe are car-behind-Q, car-behind-R, and car-behind-S, we need to calculate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(R-open|car-Q)P(car-Q) \\+ P(R-open|car-R)P(car-R) \\+ P(R-open|car-S)P(car-S)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the second term in each of those multiplications is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{3}\)&lt;/span&gt; because the prior on each door having the car is a third. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already concluded that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R-open|car-Q) = \frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; --- remember, that's just the evidence we have, we already used it in the numerator.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that Monty can't open the door with the car behind it, so we know that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R-open|car-R) = 0\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third term is a little difficult to figure out---and this, I suspect, is where all the mathematicians who &lt;a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-time-everyone-corrected-the-worlds-smartest/"&gt;wrote angrily to Marilyn vos Savant&lt;/a&gt; went wrong. Here's a mistake you might make: since all Monty has to do is open a door without the car behind it, and neither Q nor S has the car behind it, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R-open|car-S) = \frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. If you think that, you'll end up with a denominator of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{3}\)&lt;/span&gt; and an ultimate, incorrect but intuitive, calculation of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(B|A) = \frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.  But this would be wrong.  The thing you need to remember is that we've been writing out the problem in shorthand.  Monty's decision as to which door to open was made not only with knowledge of where the car is, but also with knowledge of which door the player picked.  So the longhand version of the calculation for our denominator is actually: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P(R-open|car-Q, picked-Q)P(car-Q) \\+ P(R-open|car-R, picked-Q)P(car-R) \\+ P(R-open|car-S, picked-Q)P(car-S)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other rule that we can't forget is that Monty also can't open a door that the player picked.  So the player picked Q---if the car is behind S, the only door Monty can open is R. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P(R-open|car-S, picked-Q) = 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives us the denominator: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3} + 0 + \frac{1}{3}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which we can easily simplify: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;meaning that our overall Bayes Rule formula is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$\frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simplify by canceling the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; -s and you get the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned that most of the work in applying Bayes Rule is figuring out how to define the events for which we're trying to make probability judgments---how to formalize our idea of what we started out knowing, what we've learned (our evidence), and what we're trying to figure out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, for a discussion of how lawyers appear to be susceptible to screwing up Bayes Rule, an article called &lt;a href="https://academic-oup-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/lpr/article/15/4/239/2580528"&gt;Miss Rate Neglect in Legal Evidence&lt;/a&gt; reports on a number of experiements with legally trained subjects where they do things like inappropriately flip around conditional probabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scavenger hunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our second major task this week was to do a &lt;a href="https://sociologicalgobbledygook.com/in-class-exercise-data-scavenger-hunt.html"&gt;Data Scavenger Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.  Things started a little bumpy, because lots of people had trouble getting the data loaded, mainly due to the diversity of platforms in the class.  (And also because I went around to help windows users, and didn't notice that many were actually using the Azure version, and hence didn't have their local downloads... sorry about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to finish this on Monday, and then I'll post some solutions after we're done.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also fixed the ergonomics of getting data. There's a private web server for this class at &lt;a href="https://gobbledygook.herokuapp.com/"&gt;https://gobbledygook.herokuapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;.  I'll give you a password for it in class (and will also post it on ICON).  Whenever you need to load a dataset, you will just be able to use Pandas to load it directly from this server.  Here's how.  Assume the password is PASSWORD and the file you're trying to load is FILENAME.CSV.  Then if you have Pandas imported as &lt;code&gt;pd&lt;/code&gt;, the code &lt;code&gt;df=pd.read_csv("https://gobbledygook.herokuapp.com/data?file=FILENAME.CSV&amp;amp;password=PASSWORD")&lt;/code&gt; will save the dataset as a Pandas dataframe to the variable &lt;code&gt;df&lt;/code&gt;.  No more mess with Windows file paths and local downloads vs. Azure notebooks or downloading files from ICON or any of that nonsense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be using a variety of datasets in the rest of this class, so get used to that command.  Also, the server might start up slowly sometimes, so if it looks like it's hanging when you try to load a dataset, just wait 30 seconds or so and it'll be fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Incidentally, this method of authenticating users by passing passwords in GET request parameters is a &lt;a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/147188/is-it-bad-practice-to-use-get-method-as-login-username-password-for-administrato"&gt;terrible idea&lt;/a&gt;, it's totally insecure. Don't do it for anything you ever build. I'm just doing it here because we don't need real security, just minimal privacy against casual misuse.  And also because I'm going to tear down the server the moment class is over.)&lt;/p&gt;

For example, in biology we might ask things like "does this drug reduce deaths from heart disease," in economics we might ask "does raising the minimum wage increase unemploment." In law, such questions will come up in any substantive area where the outcome of litigation depends on attributing factual responsibility. The most obvious area is torts: in a toxic tort case, for example, the plaintiff will need to be able to show that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Civil_Action"&gt;the poison the defendant dumped into the water supply&lt;/a&gt; actually caused the children to get sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about causation in the scientific sense is that it more or less maps to our ideas of causation in tort law. (Philosophers disagree about the details of all this stuff, but it's proven pretty workable for actual scientists.) In that tort-y sense, it's all about &lt;em&gt;counterfactuals&lt;/em&gt;---that is, when we imagine what it might mean for X to have caused Y, we imagine a world which is completely identical to the real world, except that X didn't happen, and we want to know whether Y happened in that world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also think our ideas of causation in tort law map to other legal contexts that aren't as explicitly about causation. For example, we can treat many kinds of intentional discrimination cases as causal questions: when we ask "did the prosecutor challenge the jurors because of their race," we mean "was it race or something else that the prosecutor was using as their reason to exclude them," and what that amounts to for practical purposes is "but for their race, would they have been excluded," i.e., the counterfactual question. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, we can create the identical world where X didn't happen. This is what a &lt;strong&gt;scientific experiment&lt;/strong&gt;, in its ideal form, does. If we want to know whether drug X helps people recover from heart disease, we can give it to people, and compare their outcomes to people who didn't get the drug.  Assuming the people who get the drug are identical to the people who didn't get the drug (&lt;em&gt;foreshadowing:&lt;/em&gt; this is a super-heavy assumption that will drive everything else we do in talking about causation), the results of the experiment will lead us to a belief about whether the drug caused improvements in outcomes in the patients who got it. And, supposing the patients are identical to the people who might need the drug out in the world, that lets us come to conclusions about whether the drug will cause health improvements if doctors give it to their patients---which is, ultimately, what we want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do experiments in the legal context as well. The most prominent example, which we'll focus on this week, is the practice of discrimination testing. In many contexts, but particularly in housing discrimination, litigants or potential litigants develop evidence using experimental methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic setup in these contexts goes like this: someone claims that they've been discriminated against by a leasing company, e.g., on the basis of race. An anti-discrimination organization sends people who look similar on paper (similar mannerisms, similar stories about employment and credit, etc.) to go to the leasing office and inquire about apartments. If the company tells everyone of one race "we have a bunch of apartments available, they're $500 a month, please take an application!" and tells the otherwise-identical people of another race "there aren't any apartments available... maybe you can get on the waiting list for an application, but all our apartments are $1000/month," then there's pretty good evidence that the difference in race caused the difference in behavior, that is, that the leasing company is engaging in illegal discrimination. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations on a theme of not identical I: changing the experimental subjects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the work in what I said above is in the notion of "identical." There are lots of ways that the world of an experiment can be not identical to the world that we care about learning about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we could have random variation just in terms of how the thing that's supposed to be doing the causing (the &lt;em&gt;treatment&lt;/em&gt;) works. Maybe the heart disease drug only works for 10% of people and we didn't get those people in our study. (Or it only works for 10% of people and we got all of those in our study!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, the solution for this kind of random variation is &lt;em&gt;sample size&lt;/em&gt;---as we discussed before, the genius of the law of large numbers is that when we sample from a population, we can expect the mean of the sample (here, the degree of susceptibility to the drug) to converge to the population mean, so the larger the group of people in our study (which will always be a sample from the larger population of people who might need a heart disease drug), the more confident we can be that the extent to which people in our study respond to the drug will be the same as the extent to which people in general do so. &lt;br&gt;
        - Note that I'm ignoring some mathematical formalities here (like the difference between sampling with and without replacement, a bunch of stuff about the concept of mathematical expectation, etc).  This will be good enough for present purposes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we could have &lt;em&gt;nonrandom&lt;/em&gt; variation in terms of the match between our sample and the population. For a blunt example, suppose our study only had men participating. Maybe women respond differently to the drug than men? (This is a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4800017/"&gt;longstanding real-world&lt;/a&gt; problem in medical studies.) Then we would have strong reason to worry that maybe we were missing some effect of the drug linked to sex (such as an interaction with sex-linked hormone levels).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the solution to this problem is &lt;em&gt;random sampling&lt;/em&gt; (although experimental researchers have created a bunch of fancy variations on random sampling for special situations, which we won't cover in this class). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intuition here is that if you don't randomly sample in selecting the people for your study, you're not really studying the whole population, you're studying some subset of the population, like just men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pervasive problem in psychological research, for at least two reasons. First, many psychologists use opportunistic ("convenience") samples of undergraduates, often assigned to participate in studies as part of classes---and they might not be identical to the the general population. Second, there are cross-cultural differences in lots of psychological factors, so studies that focus on participants from only a small subset of countries (like Americans, because America has such a robust university system) can &lt;a href="https://www-nature-com.proxy.lib.uiowa.edu/articles/466029a"&gt;fail to generalize to people from other cultures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments typically have treatment and control groups so we can compare them, and another source of this kind of nonrandom variation is if people aren't assigned randomly to treatment and control groups. For example, what happens if in our housing discrimination there are systematic differences other than race between the groups of people sent into the leasing office? Suppose, for example, that everyone in one group wore a tie, and nobody in the other group did. We won't know whether it's race that caused the different treatment, or whether the leasing agent just prefers people who dress up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations on a theme of not identical II: changing the experimental context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember I said above that our ideal of causation involves identifying a world where X (our candidate cause) didn't happen, and seeing how things vary from a world where X did happen. Sometimes, however, we don't have the ability to manipulate X independent of manipulating other things in the world, so it's impossible to create truly identical worlds with and without X happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example: a lot of psychological experiments happen in artificial contexts. For example, they'll be trying to test some social phenomenon, like whether people with deeper voices are more convincing, so they'll invite a bunch of undergraduates into a lab and ask them to watch videos of people making political speeches.  If the students who see the deeper-voiced speaker (saying identical content) are more convinced by the political position the speech espoused, that's evidence that voice pitch matters to persuasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty with that experiment is that real-world speeches don't happen in labs. And that might make a difference to the result. Continuing our hypothetical voice pitch experiment: suppose deeper voices are easier to hear over cheering crowds?  Then deeper voices might be more convincing in the real world of political rallies (just because the audiences can hear what they say) but not in the lab. Because we can't vary X while holding everything else in the world constant, we might not be able to learn about that effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychologists use the term &lt;em&gt;external validity&lt;/em&gt; to capture this class of worries: is the setting of the study similar enough to the real world to allow it to be used to make inferences about that real world? By contrast, many of the issues we discussed in the previous subsection often get described under the rubric of &lt;em&gt;internal validity&lt;/em&gt;, that is, whether we genuinely believe that the effects we observe in an experiment are the result of our changing X, as opposed to some other source of variation created between treatment and control like having all men in the treatment group. (Psychologists talk about lots of other sub-types of validity too, but we won't bother with that here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lab experiments vs field experiments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In social scientific context (and many experimental contexts in the law, like those housing testers I mentioned, are effectively social science contexts) there are two general kinds of experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;lab experiments&lt;/em&gt; the researcher controls the environment, so they have total control over which participants recieve the treatment (the deep-voiced speech, the heart disease drug) and which don't, they can make sure all other influences are held constant between the groups, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;field experiments&lt;/em&gt; the researcher applies the treatment to randomly selected people out in the real world, in the natural context where the treatment might be relevant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our housing discrimination tests are examples of field experiments---they don't take a bunch of leasing agents into the lab and show them videos of black and white prospective tenants; they send the black and white tenants out into the real environment where leasing decisions are made and see what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(There are also more specialized kinds of experiments that draw on features of both. For example, many political scientists conduct what are known as &lt;em&gt;survey experiments&lt;/em&gt; where variation is introduced in the questions asked on large, national, random surveys in order to test things like the extent to which the order of candidate names matters for who people say they favor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an inherent tradeoff between internal and external validity in lab vs field experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab experiments are likely to have problems with external validity, because the lab can never fully resemble the real-world environment where the phenomena we care about are actually occurring.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field experiments are likely to have problems with internal validity, because the world introduces a lot of variation that the experimenter can't control. For example, what happens to our housing discrimination test if a real tenant shows up and rents the last apartment midway through? Or what happens if several of our white testers get sick and start coughing all over the leasing agent?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, in other words, no perfect research design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Variations on a theme of not identical III: experimental vs observational studies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all research is experimental; indeed, there are many areas of research that can't be experimental. For example, my own Ph.D. field of political science has huge amounts of research that can't be studied effectively with experiments. If we want to know how having a war affects whether a state is democratic a few years later, we obviously don't have the power to start a war and see what happens, and even if we had the power, it would be egregiously unethical to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In law, similarly, if we're trying to figure out whether the defendant's negligent dumping of the poison in the water supply caused the kids to get cancer, we obviously aren't going to be able to randomly select some control towns and some treatment towns, dump poison in the water supply of the treatment towns, and then wait a couple decades to see how many kids die.  Also, in law we often want to borrow scientific methods to study behavior retrospectively---to come to some kind of conclusion about whether &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; disparaties in salary were caused by discrimination &lt;em&gt;over an extended period of time&lt;/em&gt;, for example---but we can't get in a time machine and vary gender in the defendant's workplace to figure that out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these contexts, we have to do &lt;em&gt;observational research&lt;/em&gt; where instead of controlling who gets the treatment, we have to look at the world and see if there are differences in outcomes for who actually got the treatment. For example, look at employees in the workplace and see if there are differences in salary for who got "assigned" (by "nature," that is, not by some scientist) the "treatment" of being a woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we don't have the ability to create otherwise identical worlds in which people get or do not get the treatment, observational research can be very difficult. We'll spend some time over the rest of the course on this, but here is a brief a sampling of the difficulties: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection bias&lt;/em&gt; is when the people whom nature assigns to treatment are systematically different than the people whom nature assigns to a control. For example, suppose we want to know whether a workplace discriminates against redheads, so we compare the salaries of redheads and the salaries of brunettes. But suppose that the employer has a reputation (deserved or undeserved) as being hostile to redheads, so only desperate readheads who can't get a job anywhere else end up working there. They might be systematically worse qualified than brunettes, within that workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Omitted variables&lt;/em&gt; are a problem when the omitted variable is causally related both to X, the thing you're trying to test, and Y, the thing you're trying to see if X causes. There are lots of ways this might happen---maybe Z, the omitted variable, causes X, which causes Y.  Maybe X causes Y only in the presence of Z. There are entire research agendas organized around different ways causal inferences can go wrong in the presence of external variables. We'll discuss some of this later in the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reverse causation&lt;/em&gt; sometimes we think X causes Y, but actually Y causes X.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, we'll be talking about experimental research; for several weeks thereafter, we'll be talking about the various ways people get around the problems of doing observational research. For now, if you'd like to read more, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2780010/"&gt;here's a good summary of the basic causal issues in observational science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty right-skewed.  Not really a normal distribution, but not so extreme to be something like an exponential distribution either---as we'd expect given the restricted range of salaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.  What are the mean, median, and mode of salaries? How do they change from year to year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we've already seen the first two of those; the mode is a trick question, because the salaries are granular enough that they're unique, there isn't really a mode.  but we could use our histograms with different bin sizes to get a sense of where they clump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  What data visualization would you use to get a look at the relationship between gender and salaries? What do we learn from that visualization?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A boxplot is always a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we can immediately observe is that there's a gender difference, but that the gender difference isn't necessarily huge---the highlighted boxes represent the interquartile range (if seaborn does it normally)---the 25th to 75th percentiles, and there's a good amount of overlap.  (The whiskers are 1.5 times that range, and then the dots are outliers that are beyond that range.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also observe that there are a lot more outliers among the women, which are likely to drag things like the mean for women up; whether this is ok or not (i.e., or whether we should prefer the median) is something we could argue about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.  Can we subdivide the dataset in some useful way to get more insight about the relationship between gender and salaries under different conditions? Come up with something that helps us learn more, and visualize it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's simulate some housing discrimination tester data.  Suppose a testing organization hired 20 white people and 20 black people, trained them to behave identically and give identical answers to landlord questions, and sent them into a large housing complex to inquire about one-bedroom apartments.  The testers were instructed to ask how much rent is on one-bedrooms in the complex, but not to ask for an application---and then to record how much they were quoted, and whether they were offered an application anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll assume that whether they're offered an application is a bernouli variable, i.e., a coin flip, and that the rent they're quoted is normally distributed. We'll simulate some racist data, i.e., where the probability that black people get offered an application is lower, and the mean rent is higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we'll do is a simple t-test for difference of means here.  The data isn't paired (i.e., in our hypothetical research design, the housing organization didn't send two people who were matched on other characteristics, one white and one black, in to test.) so we can use the independent t-test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like we can reject the null hypothesis that white and black rents are the same. How about offering applications?  There, we have a binary categorical variable, so we should go for something like a chi-squared test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually brushed over some complexities in the chi-squared test in the catalogue of hypothesis tests lesson.  There are three different flavors of the chi-squared test: a test for independence, for homogeneity, and for goodness of fit. The goodness-of-fit one is for testing whether a set of categorial data came from a hypothesis discrete distribution. We don't need that here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the test for independence and the test for homogeneity is a bit subtle.  The most common explanation of the difference is that the test for independence is for research designs where you collect two observations for each member of the sample (i.e., their race and whether they were offered an application); whereas the test for homogeneity is for research designs where you sample the subpopulations separately, i.e., sample a bunch of white people and a bunch of black people and then observe who got an application.  &lt;a href="http://inspire.stat.ucla.edu/unit_13/"&gt;Here's a good explanation&lt;/a&gt; of the flavors of chi-squared tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that, mathematically, the tests of independence and homogeneity are the same, the only difference is in interpretation.  So we can use what we've already learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like we can't quite reject (at the standard 0.05 level) the null hypothesis that white and black folks are given applications similarly---which should suggest something to our testing organization about maybe having picked a research design with a bigger sample size, since the differences look pretty stark in the crosstab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, Fisher's exact test is also available to us, so let's do one more test just to see what we get.  (In scientific context, you should really precommit to the tests you'll carry out before doing so, since, let's recall, that if you look at the data a bunch of times, you might get significant results just by chance.  So what I'm about to do is technically &lt;em&gt;a bit dirty&lt;/em&gt; and I really should have just done this first.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh look, I managed to torture a significant result out of the data.  See above as to why this is cheating.  But also, probably reach for Fisher's exact test first.  Also, we could have gone for a z test of independence of proportions---google it if you're curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Paired-data"&gt;Paired data&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#Paired-data"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypothetical test I described doesn't quite match the examples given in many of our housing discrimination cases. Often, these organizations use paired/matched testers instead. That is, they send one black person and one white person close together in time, and where they match on everything else that might be relevant to the landlord (income, number of pets, general personality and good looks, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This violates one of the assumptions of both the standard t-test and the chi-squared/fisher tests, namely that the samples are independent.  But we have tests for this purpose too, including the paired t-test and McNemar's test.  (I didn't cover McNemar's test in the catalogue of hypothesis tests, but it's the equivalent of the chi-squared test for paired data.)  I'll also break out the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, discussed at the end of the catalogue of hypothesis tests, just because I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than simulate new data, let's just change the assumption of our implicit data.  Let's assume they were paired, and that the pairings correspond to equivalent positions in the subsets of the DataFrame we already have (i.e., that the first white person was paired with the first black person, and so forth).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mcnemar's test is &lt;a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.contingency_tables.mcnemar.html"&gt;buried in statsmodels&lt;/a&gt;, and it has a really obnoxious API that doesn't take Pandas dataframes, and returns some idiotic object called a "bunch."  It's very annoying.  But we can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: if you actually find yourself doing this kind of research on a regular basis, I'd probably recommend switching from Python to R; as a language it's better suited to this kind of bread-and-butter statistics, although less well-suited to lots of the other stuff we do in this class.

&lt;div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on this: if we wanted to implement something like this more robustly, it would be a bad idea to do it with all this floating point math in raw Python.  Floating point math tends to be a little bit shaky (i.e., inaccurate) unless you're careful with it, and when working with very small probabilities, it would get more shaky still. Instead, I'd either operate with fractions, or use an arbitrary precision math library like &lt;a href="http://mpmath.org/"&gt;mpmath&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the trick for why our hypothetical test with these numbers is actually pretty reliable, is that psi is small, and cubing it is tiny, which makes the first term in the denominator really tiny.since the second term in the denominator is the same as the numerator, this means our fraction is close to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart of the lesson here is that combining indicators make the evidence much stronger, so long as the combined indicators appear really really really rarely in the negative case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="question-1.b"&gt;question 1.b&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#question-1.b"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just a straightforward application of Bayes rule. The setup is that we want probability of drugs given SSS. Again, I'm going to throw Bayes rule in your face:&lt;/p&gt;
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)P(B)}{P(A)}$$&lt;p&gt;So B is "has drugs" and A is "sketchy AND seedy and shady."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get $P(A|B)$ we can observe that sketchy, seedy, and shady are conditionally independent on having drugs, so the multiplication rule works. That's &lt;code&gt;prob_sss_cond_drugs()&lt;/code&gt; up above.  Then $P(B)$ is given to us as mu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the denominator, we use the total probability rule yet again.  We can divide the world into two states of affairs --- the state of affairs where someone has drugs, and the state of affairs where someone doesn't.  We can use the multiplication rule again in both cases because the problem specified that s, s, and s are conditionally independent on drugs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; on nodrugs. (See, I was trying to make this nice and easy!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="question-1.c"&gt;question 1.c&lt;a class="anchor-link" href="#question-1.c"&gt;&amp;#182;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sketchiness isn't conditionally independent of shadiness given non-drug-carrying, 
we could not use the prob_ss_cond_nodrugs function up above. We'd have to find the probability of sketchiness conditional on shadiness, and multiply that by the probability of shadiness, and then multiply all that by the probability of seediness, in order to get the equivalent term.  Assuming that you're more likely to be sketchy if you're shady (and not carrying drugs), this would increase our denominator, thus reducing the likelihood that the profile gets it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First&lt;/strong&gt;, a couple students asked whether you need to center and scale (standardize) data to make it work with linear regression.  I think I had a brain freeze and gave an inconsistent answer, so let me clarify here: no, you don't.  Even if you're doing multiple regression, and the different right-side variables are on wildly different scales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some intuition for why this is the case, and why wildly different scales won't distort regression results the same way that outliers do, think about a graph again. When we do a linear regression, each variable is its own dimension, and so each coefficient is optimized to minimize the squared residuals &lt;em&gt;along its dimension&lt;/em&gt;.  For example, if you are trying to test whether distance from a university is associated with rental prices, you might run a regression that has, say, number of miles from nearest university and median income of the census tract on the right side and rent on the left side (this is kind of a crappy regression, because you'd want lots of other things that might confound the relationship here, like number of bedrooms, and also because as usual you'd probably want to take a close look at the income variable over its range and make sure it doesn't need to be transformed, but let's run with it for purposes of illustration).  Each point in the ultimate regression plane will be located in four-dimensional space: it'll have a value for miles, income, and rent. Let's say rent is on the y axis, income (in thousands/year) is on the x axis, and miles are on the z axis, and represent your regression model as &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y=\alpha \cdot x + \beta \cdot z + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's imagine that we've fit a regression, and we've found coefficients for it, hypothetically, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y= -100 \cdot x + 50 \cdot z + \epsilon\)&lt;/span&gt;.  In other words, for every additional mile away from a university, rent goes down by a hundred bucks, and for every thousand dollars/year median income in the census tract it goes up by fifty bucks. Then imagine that you go back into your dataset and change it to be hundreds of dollars of income/year (i.e., multiply every income by 10). Effectively, what this amounts to is scaling the z axis in the regression, so the plane would stay the same shape, but the points for income would change, they'd all be divided by 10, and you'd end up with the same model with different coefficients. But that would've affect the coefficients along the other dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another good way to see this, actually, is just to play with some data yourself.  Go and get the data from my rule of law book, for example and do a regression with, say, property rights, political pluralism, and GDP on the right side, note the coefficients and p-values, and then standardize the variables (or just multiply them by something, or add something to them, or do anything else you can dream of).  See what kinds of transformations change the t-scores and p-values and what don't.  (They'll all change the coefficients.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, run the following code: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;statsmodels.formula.api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;http://rulelaw.net/downloads/rol-scores.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;gdp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2012GDP&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# just to fix a glitch with columns starting with numbers&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;bigorg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;assoc_org&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;shiftbigorg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;bigorg&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;model3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;formula&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;pol_plur ~ shiftbigorg + free_expr + gdp&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What you'll notice is that the statistically meaningful stuff, i.e., the t-scores and p-values on the right-side variables, r-squared, etc., don't actually change under these transformations. (If you want to test your intuition further, try to figure out why the coefficient on the intercept and the coefficient on the variable we're messing with, each of which doesn't much matter, each change on exactly one of those...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, standardizing doesn't hurt, and it can help with interpreting coefficients by having everything be on the same scale for a sorta apples-to-apples comparison.  Also, when you're messing around with interaction terms (which I haven't taught you yet, but I will, planning to discuss in part 2 of our regressions material around week 12...) or polynomial regressions there are sometimes meaningful reasons to do it. See more discussion &lt;a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/standardize-variables-regression/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second&lt;/strong&gt;, with our reorganization/slow-down of the syllabus in response to mid-semester-feedback requests, we won't get to as much of the problems with models material as I was expecting before pset 3 is due.  Accordingly, problem 2.3 might be more difficult than I'd intended. So if you'd like, instead of doing 2.3, you can repeat 2.2 with a different (but plausible) method of analysis, like a different regression model or hypothesis test.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a combination of some of the code Sam kindly showed us in class, plus the visualizations I showed you, for our simpson's paradox example on 3/25/19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few additional FYIs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the underlying dataset is an article entitled "&lt;a href="http://jse.amstat.org/v22n1/mickel.pdf"&gt;Simpson’s Paradox: A Data Set and Discrimination Case Study&lt;/a&gt;" in the Journal of Statistics Education, Volume 22, Number 1 (2014) by Stanley A. Taylor and Amy E. Mickel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor and Mickel talk about pivot tables as a good solution for looking at these data in their article. That's a slightly more powerful version of some of the groupby code Sam showed us.  For a nice explanation of how to do pivot tables in Pandas, see &lt;a href="https://pbpython.com/pandas-pivot-table-explained.html"&gt;this web page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I'm going to change the function that generates the violin plot to let me loop over and show a plot for each cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
